ADVENTURE  I.  A SC
ANDAL IN BOHEMIA

I.


To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any othe
r name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to l
ove for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balan
ced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover
 he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a snee
r. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But fo
r the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduc
e a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a cr
ack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. 
And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.


I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and 
the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were
 sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul,
 remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between coca
ine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, de
eply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in f
ollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff mur
der, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission w
hich he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his
 activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend 
and companion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I
 had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, 
which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was
 seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms 
were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against 
the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind hi
m. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He h
ad risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown
 up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was gl
ad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across hi
s case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked 
me over in his singular introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put
 on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Ju
st a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into
 harness."

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very 
wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much.
 You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thu
rsday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mar
y Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."


He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes te
ll me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost 
parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole
 in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, a
nd that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentl
eman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and 
a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I 
do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with w
hich he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appear
s to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your rea
soning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so,
" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. Th
e distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"
Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"
Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen s
teps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since
 you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw ove
r a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said 
he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-ni
ght, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepe
st moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be tr
usted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all q
uarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This
 is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake
 to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit 
facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which 
it was written.

"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's
 processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"Peculi
ar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and
 saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"Wha
t do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 
'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction li
ke our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He t
ook down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking coun
try--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numer
ous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a 
great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man wh
o wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have fro
m all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous 
to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper an
d prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

A
s he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull a
t the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A ni
ce little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if
 there is nothing else."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost 
without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never
 mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your be
st attention."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately ou
tside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly
 have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a
 richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across 
the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was
 lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boot
s which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impress
ion of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, whi
le he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had a
pparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the fa
ce he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of re
solution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marke
d German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to addr
ess.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough 
to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian n
obleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a ma
tter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."

I rose to go, but 
Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before t
his gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said h
e, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importanc
e. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."

"
I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person wh
o employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just cal
led myself is not exactly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy
, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise on
e of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary
 kings of Bohemia."

"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing h
is eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no 
doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his ey
es and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked
, "I should be better able to advise you."

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrol
lable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "
You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your
 Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duk
e of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting d
own once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doin
g such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putt
ing myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult,"
 said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit
 to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.
"

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted 
a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a perso
n on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of
 a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" sa
id Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Wa
rsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangl
ed with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."


"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"The
n I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, 
how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is the writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."


"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! Th
at is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised your
self seriously."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We hav
e tried and failed."

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attem
pts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Tw
ice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is qu
ite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

"Very, inde
ed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"S
o I have heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know th
e strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct wou
ld bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I kn
ow that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of w
omen, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to whi
ch she would not go--none."

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has
 said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, 
then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of impor
tance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"

"Certainly. You w
ill find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how
 we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"


"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."

"And for present expens
es?"

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

"There are three hund
red pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book an
d handed it to him.

"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."


Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-nig
ht, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as t
he wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at th
ree o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."

II.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker
 Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'c
lock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might b
e. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange feat
ures which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the e
xalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which
 my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, w
hich made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disent
angled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of hi
s failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking gro
om, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as
 I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it 
was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectabl
e, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily
 for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, 
limp and helpless, in the chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employe
d my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and per
haps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left
 the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sy
mpathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Br
iony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories.
 Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,
 and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save 
that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely f
rom every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as
 I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in 
rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, an
d as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbou
rhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of I
rene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a 
bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five
 every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only on
e male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and ofte
n twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had dri
ven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell,
 I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norto
n was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation betwe
en them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, 
she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this q
uestion depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers 
in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these det
ails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."

"I am following you
 closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and 
a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I
 had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened t
he door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
 glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of h
er I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he
 pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross 
& Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in
 twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the 
lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all t
he tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and
 into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die 
for.

" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This
 was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behi
nd her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in befo
re he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It 
was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I d
on't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horse
s were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there sa
ve the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all thr
ee standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a 
church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard a
s he could towards me.

" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

" 'What then?' I asked.

" 'Come, man, com
e, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I f
ound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and g
enerally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in a
n instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman bea
med on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the tho
ught of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that
 the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved th
e bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I 
mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "
and what then?"

"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate dep
arture, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated
, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said
 as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangement
s."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to thin
k of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

"I 
shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"No
t in a good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"B
ut what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he 
turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not muc
h time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns
 from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I h
ave already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come w
hat may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasa
ntness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitti
ng-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for 
I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to th
row, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formi
dable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted w
ith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it 
will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in te
n minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and
 at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."


"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I pr
epare for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the charact
er of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, h
is sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could hav
e equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to va
ry with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when h
e became a specialist in crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes
 to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted
 as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as
 I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I ex
pected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group o
f shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were fl
irting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouth
s.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matter
s. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by
 Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to
 find the photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size
. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and 
searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about wit
h her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neit
her. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone el
se? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brough
t to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where 
she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not 
know how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But sh
e will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orde
rs to the letter."

As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was 
a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the co
rner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had
 rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took si
des with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck
, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and strug
gling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the
 lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his f
ace. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of 
better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to atte
nd to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with
 her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman muc
h hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll 
be gone before you can get him to hospital."

"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's pu
rse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't 
lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa
. This way, please!"

Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I 
still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,
 so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that mo
ment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I
 saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the
 injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrus
ted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not inju
ring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion li
ke a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise h
is hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mou
th than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a gener
al shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of 
rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping
 through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my fri
end's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes un
til we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Docto
r," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is.
"

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish 
to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the str
eet was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, 
I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and b
ecame a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound
 to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay 
between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they we
re compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a w
oman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a pe
rfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitu
tion Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an un
married one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more p
recious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The s
moke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behi
nd a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she h
alf drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the 
room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to a
ttempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed 
safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I 
shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room
 to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be
 a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning
. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a c
omplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had s
topped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock
 Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth
 in an ulster who had hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "N
ow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."

III.


I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upo
n our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cr
ied, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?
"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting
."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is marr
ied," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But sh
e could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty all
 fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your M
ajesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish 
she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not br
oken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the s
teps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she
.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My
 mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing
 Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean tha
t she has left England?"

"Never to return."

"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall se
e." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was s
cattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked t
hem before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, 
pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was supe
rscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it toge
ther. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really
 did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I 
found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if
 the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you m
ade me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, 
kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I oft
en take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my w
alking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made 
sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wishe
d you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resource was flight, when 
pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph
, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hi
ndrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will
 always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to posse
ss; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,


"Very truly yours,              
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a wo
man--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how q
uick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?
"

"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holm
es coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."


"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate.
 The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely
 indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his f
inger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,"
 said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photogr
aph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. 
I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the 
King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatene
d to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He us
ed to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Ad
ler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

ADVENTURE  II.  THE 
RED-HEADED LEAGUE


I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found hi
m in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my
 intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"You
 could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were enga
ged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has be
en my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use t
o me in yours also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little qu
estioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and p
utting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my 
love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your rel
ish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to e
mbellish so many of my own little adventures."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I obser
ved.

"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by
 Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is al
ways far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"Yo
u did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact 
on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been 
good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular whic
h I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often
 connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt w
hether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the pres
ent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ev
er listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not me
rely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story ma
kes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of t
he course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In t
he present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client pu
ffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside 
pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flat
tened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read th
e indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspecti
on. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore 
rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab w
aistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed t
op-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I wo
uld, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and 
discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile a
s he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he t
akes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing 
lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, bu
t his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How 
did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Yo
ur hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscle
s are more developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling y
ou how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpi
n."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny f
or five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but C
hina?"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I hav
e made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staini
ng the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging 
from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said
 he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I b
egin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, an
d my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertiseme
nt, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "H
ere it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as fol
lows:

"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.
 S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely n
ominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligibl
e. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet 
Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

H
olmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track
, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and
 the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the
 date."

"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well,
 it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a smal
l pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not d
one more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would h
ave a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"What is the name o
f this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It
's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better 
himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his 
head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a
 common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your adverti
sement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with
 a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to
 develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is 
still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the pla
ce clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the
 three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put 
us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very pape
r in his hand, and he says:

" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.


" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to 
any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at t
heir wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready fo
r me to step into.'

" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my
 business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door
-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'Have y
ou never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why, I wonder at th
at, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'

" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a 
couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'


"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some yea
rs, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he,
 showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address wher
e you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezek
iah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-he
aded men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instruc
tions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it i
s splendid pay and very little to do.'

" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'


" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. Thi
s American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I ha
ve heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fie
ry red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your whi
le to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may s
ee for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any 
competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know s
o much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to
 come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the a
ddress that was given us in the advertisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From nor
th, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advert
isement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I shoul
d not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Eve
ry shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there w
ere not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up i
n despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted
 until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon
 the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
 ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused 
and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was not
hing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was 
even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some f
ault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. Ho
wever, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the 
door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, '
and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He h
as every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on
 one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and cong
ratulated me warmly on my success.

" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, ex
cuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled w
ith the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But 
we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's
 wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of h
is voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in 
different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

" 'My name,' s
aid he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are yo
u a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" 'Dear m
e!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the 
propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you shou
ld be a bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after a
ll; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

" 'In the case of another,' sai
d he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business alre
ady,' said I.

" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after tha
t for you.'

" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.

" 'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of a
n evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very
 well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to an
ything that turned up.

" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

" 'Is $4 a week.'

" 'And the work?
'

" 'Is purely nominal.'

" 'What do you call purely nominal?'

" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least i
n the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon th
at point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'

" 'It's only four hou
rs a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.

" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickn
ess nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is to copy 
out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, an
d blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" '
Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been
 fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say
 or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in l
ow spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though wha
t its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or th
at they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spauld
ing did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the mo
rning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sh
eets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.

"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right a
s possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He st
arted me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right
 with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door
 of the office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked do
wn four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
 was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a mor
ning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an ins
tant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would 
not risk the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour a
nd Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me some
thing in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came
 to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but
 the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. 
Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-
paper. It read in this fashion:


THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSOLVED.

October 9, 1890.


Sherlock Holmes and I sur
veyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overto
pped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything 
very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh
 at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "
I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my 
saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door
?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to 
know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked
 him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. 
Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman
 at No. 4.'

" 'What, the red-headed man?'

" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicit
or and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

" 'W
here could I find him?'

" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. 
Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, an
d no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Ho
lmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way
. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not
 wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor fo
lk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."

"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an excee
dingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible t
hat graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I hav
e lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have an
y grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say 
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost 
nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playin
g this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty po
unds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assi
stant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"

"About a month 
then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Wh
y did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he li
ke, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short
 of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I
 thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me t
hat a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still w
ith you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"No
thing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy 
to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday 
we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?
"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the mo
re bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are reall
y puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"W
hat are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that 
you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk
-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange
 bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly spran
g out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"S
arasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients s
pare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your ha
t and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good 
deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, 
and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took u
s to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, litt
le, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclos
ure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and 
uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house,
 announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with
 his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked sl
owly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the
 pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the 
door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.


"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth 
left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "
He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be 
third. I have known something of him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in
 this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."


"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why di
d you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's 
country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in whi
ch we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast
 to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the 
City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inwa
rd and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as
 we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon th
e faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancin
g along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exac
t knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City
 and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to t
he other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, 
and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to 
vex us with their conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable perform
er but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,
 gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eye
s were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, a
s it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme
 exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative moo
d which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; 
and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair 
amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upo
n him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted
 with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
 that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those who
m he had set himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it wou
ld be as well."

"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is seriou
s."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in ti
me to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time
?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be s
ome little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disap
peared in an instant among the crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppresse
d with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had see
n what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was
 about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Ken
sington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the
 visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedit
ion, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smo
oth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, bu
t gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine
 when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms 
were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room,
 I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police a
gent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.


"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the ra
ck. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our
 companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequent
ial way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the r
unning down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"
You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little meth
ods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of
 a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the A
gra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all rig
ht," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for se
ven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will p
lay for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Me
rryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your han
ds."

"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head
 of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man
, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as c
unning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He
'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on 
his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-
night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his p
rofession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and
 I will follow in the second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the 
cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
 until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is
 a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not
 a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog
 and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."

We had r
eached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, fo
llowing the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened fo
r us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down 
a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lan
tern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vaul
t or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holm
es remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his sti
ck upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.


"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole suc
cess of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to 
interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, 
while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutel
y the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his g
lass in his pocket.

"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the
 good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer tim
e they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City
 branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to y
ou that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar 
at present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be
 made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed 
for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unp
ack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed b
etween layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch 
office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."

"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. 
"And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In t
he meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid s
o. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your ru
bber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.
 And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvanta
ge, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves be
hind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about s
hooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes sh
ot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never
 before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out 
at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and su
bduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "T
hat is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have a
n inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be sil
ent and wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appea
red to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for
 I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so 
acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier i
n-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the 
case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark 
upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound
, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the litt
le area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was w
ithdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between 
the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white st
ones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over th
e edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of t
he aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he sto
od at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and 
a shock of very red hair.

"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Arch
ie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other di
ved down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the
 barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone f
loor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered wi
th the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."

"There are thr
ee men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I mu
st compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see yo
ur pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the de
rbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered 
upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address
 me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please,
 sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said J
ohn Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.


"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can tha
nk you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the mos
t determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little score
s of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I 
shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways 
unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in t
he early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious fr
om the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and 
the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours
 every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method w
as no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which
 must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has
 the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absenc
e every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious t
o me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Ha
d there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the questi
on. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate pre
parations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I
 thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There w
as the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal w
ith one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which too
k many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running 
a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by bea
ting upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was 
not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we h
ad never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must 
yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only re
maining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on 
our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Sco
tland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell
 that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign
 that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. B
ut it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturda
y would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I
 expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so 
long a chain, and yet every link rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel 
it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
 problems help me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perh
aps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaub
ert wrote to George Sand."

ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY


"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on
 either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind o
f man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we c
ould fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the que
er things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of ev
ents, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventi
onalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "Th
e cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police repor
ts realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artisti
c."

"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wan
ting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the de
tails, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatu
ral as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, 
in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents
, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the 
ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his 
wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There 
is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The cr
udest of writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," s
aid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I
 was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other
 woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out h
is false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imaginati
on of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your ex
ample."

He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in s
uch contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot t
hat I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance i
n the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled up
on his finger.

"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such del
icacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."


"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any featur
e of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually
 in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect whi
ch gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the mor
e obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to 
me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may hav
e something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had 
risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London stree
t. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa roun
d her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devons
hire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our window
s, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a 
plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.


"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavem
ent always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for 
communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer 
oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that th
e maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he s
poke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady her
self loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes w
elcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an arm
chair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he 
said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, 
"but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she g
ave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about
 me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my busi
ness to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consul
t me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the poli
ce and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but stil
l I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to 
know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Hol
mes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.

Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous
 face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy wa
y in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you,
 and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on
 with my things and came right away to you."

"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is
 different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two 
months older than myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, M
r. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than h
erself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carrie
d on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior
, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could
 have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequen
tial narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little
 income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my unc
le Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amoun
t, but I can only touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum 
as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every 
way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."

"I could do with much less th
an that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so th
ey have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windib
ank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn
 at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You hav
e made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as fre
ely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss S
utherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," sh
e said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to
 mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted
 so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
 prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that 
I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, w
hen nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. H
ardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr.
 Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good a
bout it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, f
or she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Ho
smer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after t
hat we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr.
 Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."

"No?"

"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort.
 He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family
 circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet
."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again
 in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We c
ould write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no nee
d for father to know."

"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged afte
r the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What offi
ce?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"
And you don't know his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, t
hen?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the offic
e he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like 
he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they 
were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, 
Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been 
an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things a
bout Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the 
daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentl
e. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and 
a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, 
just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your s
tepfather, returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before f
ather came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened
 I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passio
n. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marry
ing within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him
 afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed fu
nny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sl
y, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the 
very morning of the wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrive
d."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir,
 but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the 
St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped him
self into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when
 the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box
 and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen
 him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then t
o throw any light upon what became of him."

"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes
.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever hap
pened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remembe
r that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding
-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, th
at some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he wo
uld not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could
 have been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was
 never to speak of the matter again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, t
hat something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in br
inging me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me 
and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never wo
uld look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-
mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to
 sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shal
l reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it f
urther. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you do
n't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my 
hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."

"I advertised for h
im in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And y
our address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your fath
er's place of business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."

"Tha
nk you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I ha
ve given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind,
 Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all th
e preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled
 our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again when
ever she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together,
 his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack
 the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with 
the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting
 study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rathe
r a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of t
he sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But 
the maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me
," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was 
important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the grea
t issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well,
 she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with blac
k beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colo
ur, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right fo
refinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly w
ell-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.


" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that yo
u have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never 
trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's s
leeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon
 her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the
 typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a simil
ar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the b
roadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her n
ose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, 
surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots w
hich she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-c
ap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first
, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd b
oots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenl
y interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note 
before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but 
you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and di
pped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this i
s amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
 description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning
 of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow comple
xion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infir
mity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain,
 and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an offic
e in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing
 over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. The
re is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only
 that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you s
ee, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very sugg
estive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly
 it bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if 
an action for breach of promise were instituted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, w
hich should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windiba
nk, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do b
usiness with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we ma
y put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle
 powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assu
red and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only 
had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back
 to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, 
I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his bl
ack clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands 
all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professi
onal case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bed
side of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a 
hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little myst
ery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his a
rmchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me t
hat he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I ent
ered.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt tha
t I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the detai
ls are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, t
hen, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had 
not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.

"This is the 
girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come
 in!"

The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skin
ned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioni
ng glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the near
est chair.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in w
hich you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not 
quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think
 it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a
 very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her m
ind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is n
ot pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you 
possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I wil
l succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delight
ed to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much indiv
iduality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more
 worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in ever
y case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen 
other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the offic
e, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"
And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writin
g another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I
 have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are al
l typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care
 to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. 
Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. H
olmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Hol
mes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" s
houted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--reall
y it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent
, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's 
right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of m
oisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between our
selves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let 
me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chai
r, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the
 mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to
 us.

"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the m
oney of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the
 loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, 
amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair persona
l advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of 
course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of ke
eping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would 
not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of goi
ng to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than 
to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinte
d glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating w
hisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other l
overs by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would 
have been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, a
nd, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant 
entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly express
ed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far
 as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally sec
ure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pre
tended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a
 dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking u
pon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the
 allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Su
therland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, sh
e would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he 
conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I thin
k that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes ha
d been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, M
r. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaki
ng the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked y
ou lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said
 Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young 
lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at 
the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting cr
op handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp 
it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr
. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, la
ughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does s
omething very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"I 
cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first
 that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the o
nly man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two m
en were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted 
spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all 
confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so
 familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together 
with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my ma
n, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description.
 I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I
 sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their
 travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his busines
s address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial bu
t characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say tha
t the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"

"And Miss Suthe
rland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him wh
o taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz 
as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY


We were seated at bre
akfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this w
ay:

"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscom
be Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."


"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have
 a fairly long list at present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lat
ely. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I 
should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must
 pack at once, for I have only half an hour."

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect 
of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was i
n a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his
 tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It 
is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with 
me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corn
er seats I shall get the tickets."

We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holme
s had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we w
ere past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you 
heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."

"The London press has n
ot had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars.
 It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a lit
tle paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and comm
onplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very se
rious case against the son of the murdered man."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall
 take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of thi
ngs to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district
 not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made 
his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hather
ley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so
 that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turne
r was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect eq
uality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of
 the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring Engl
ish families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at 
the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable house
hold, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the fac
ts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and wal
ked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Bo
scombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurr
y, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.

"From Ha
therley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. 
One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of 
Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few m
inutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under h
is arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He th
ought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

"The two McCarthys were 
seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded ro
und, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter
 of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while sh
e was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeare
d to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw
 the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away a
nd told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that
 she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up 
to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He wa
s much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fre
sh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been b
eaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflic
ted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these 
circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inqu
est on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next As
sizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hard
ly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."


"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight
 to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromisin
g manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave agains
t the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood
, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and 
who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in h
is interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentle
men are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid,
" said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is 
nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other o
bvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boastin
g when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or 
even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is 
upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as th
at."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You s
have every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as
 we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it 
is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits look
ing at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of ob
servation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the invest
igation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are 
worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return t
o Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not 
surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of rem
oving any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ej
aculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of 
events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I
 can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to 
see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indig
nation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural 
under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the si
tuation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his 
remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father,
 and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, an
d even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-
reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than 
of a guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.

"So they have.
 And many men have been wrongfully hanged."

"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afrai
d, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will fi
nd it here, and may read it for yourself."

He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, an
d having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own stat
ement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in
 this way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had b
een away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My
 father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ros
s with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of 
my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going
. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbi
t warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evid
ence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When a
bout a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I
 then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me
 rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my fat
her was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned to
wards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which cau
sed me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gu
n and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way
 to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I
 returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbiddi
ng in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Coro
ner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only ca
tch some allusion to a rat.

"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. 
I thought that he was delirious.

"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quar
rel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.

"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is real
ly impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

"T
he Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice y
our case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Coroner: I und
erstand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?

"Witness: It was.

"The Coroner: Ho
w was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"W
itness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.

"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions w
hen you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Coroner
: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of no
thing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the l
eft of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from 
my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.

" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" '
Yes, it was gone.'

" 'You cannot say what it was?'

" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

" 'How far from th
e body?'

" 'A dozen yards or so.'

" 'And how far from the edge of the wood?'

" 'About the same.'

" 'Then if it wa
s removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'

" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded 
the examination of the witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding r
emarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his fathe
r having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father,
 and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."

Holm
es laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been a
t some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you al
ternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause 
of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness an
ything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach thi
s case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will le
ad us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of
 action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when w
e at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at 
the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the
 platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroun
dings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a 
room had already been engaged for us.

"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I kne
w your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very
 nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."

Lestrade looke
d startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the
 sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
 hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed ind
ulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain a
s a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and s
uch a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that th
ere was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door
."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen i
n my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve
 lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the oth
er of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come.
 I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work
 knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, a
nd I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyo
ne who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing 
all that I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, som
e flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried
, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his sho
ulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is righ
t. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason 
why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It
 is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxi
ous that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but o
f course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything l
ike that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."

"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was h
e in favour of such a union?"

"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick b
lush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for thi
s information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The
 doctor?"

"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down c
ompletely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered.
 Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is impor
tant."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."

"Yes
, certainly."

"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."

"You will tell me if you have a
ny news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I kno
w him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I le
ave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered
, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade w
ith dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not 
over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."

"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Ha
ve you an order to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about
 going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Wats
on, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."

I walked down to the statio
n with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay up
on the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, w
hen compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from t
he action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the 
events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what 
absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father,
 and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What
 could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and call
ed for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was
 stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered
 by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck f
rom behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his f
ather. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, 
it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What c
ould that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it w
as more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to 
find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
 murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the har
dihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces
 off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and
 yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to
 strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back 
alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat do
wn. "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man s
hould be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long j
ourney. I have seen young McCarthy."

"And what did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"No
ne at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am co
nvinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and
, I should think, sound at heart."

"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was aver
se to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."

"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This 
fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really kne
w her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a b
armaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how madd
ening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be
 absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his fath
er, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supp
orting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he kn
own the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not 
know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding
 from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written t
o him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I t
hink that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."

"But if he is innocent, who ha
s done it?"

"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had 
an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and 
he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew th
at his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George M
eredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had fore
told, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we se
t off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.

"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said
 that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.


"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some 
time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great b
enefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."

"Indeed! That is interesting," said
 Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."


"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, a
nd to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is,
 presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposa
l and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The da
ughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?"

"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," 
said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and 
fancies."

"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."

"Anyhow, I have gr
asped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.

"And that is-
-"

"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moo
nshine."

"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this
 is not Hatherley Farm upon the left."

"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-sto
ried, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chim
neys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the
 door, when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and als
o a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or 
eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track whic
h led to Boscombe Pool.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only 
known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkene
d. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. 
His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his lo
ng, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutel
y concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, onl
y provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through 
the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, an
d there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometim
es Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I
 walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which spr
ang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which 
is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm 
and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the
 red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the
 woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees
 and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed,
 so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To
 Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled 
grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.

"What did you go into 
the pool for?" he asked.

"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how o
n earth--"

"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mol
e could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before
 they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and t
hey have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet
." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself 
than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are de
eply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then
 here are the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son sto
od listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, the
y go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes
 losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great b
eech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more
 upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and drie
d sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground 
but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he car
efully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all tr
aces were lost.

"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fanc
y that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perh
aps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be
 with you presently."

It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still car
rying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.

"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding
 it out. "The murder was done with it."

"I see no marks."

"There are none."

"How do you know, then?"

"The grass w
as growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It cor
responds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon."

"And the murderer?"

"Is a tall man, left-handed,
 limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-hold
er, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid 
us in our search."

Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, 
but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."

"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own met
hod, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.
"

"And leave your case unfinished?"

"No, finished."

"But the mystery?"

"It is solved."

"Who was the criminal, th
en?"

"The gentleman I describe."

"But who is he?"

"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such 
a populous neighbourhood."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot un
dertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-sto
ck of Scotland Yard."

"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-b
ye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."

Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we foun
d lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who fi
nds himself in a perplexing position.

"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this
 chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a 
cigar and let me expound."

"Pray do so."

"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCa
rthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One wa
s the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singul
ar dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. No
w from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is abso
lutely true."

"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"

"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as 
far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the 
attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one whi
ch is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at B
oscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia."

"What of the rat, then?"

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper f
rom his pocket and flattened it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bri
stol for it last night." He put his hand over part of the map. "What do you read?"

"ARAT," I read.

"And now?" He ra
ised his hand.

"BALLARAT."

"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last 
two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."

"It is wonderful!" I exclai
med.

"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment 
was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere va
gueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."

"Certainly."

"And one who was
 at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could har
dly wander."

"Quite so."

"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the triflin
g details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."

"But how did you gain them
?"

"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles."

"His height I know that you might roughly j
udge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."

"Yes, they were peculiar boots
."

"But his lameness?"

"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight
 upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame."

"But his left-handedness."

"You were yourself struck by the nature 
of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upo
n the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the i
nterview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge
 of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, an
d written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having fo
und the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cig
ar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam."

"And the cigar-holder?"

"I could see that the end had not been i
n his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, s
o I deduced a blunt pen-knife."

"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, 
and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direct
ion in which all this points. The culprit is--"

"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our s
itting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping s
tep and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his en
ormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled h
air, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face 
was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear 
to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.

"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holm
es gently. "You had my note?"

"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid
 scandal."

"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."

"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across 
at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, ans
wering the look rather than the words. "It is so. I know all about McCarthy."

The old man sank his face in his hands
. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have
 spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes."

"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would h
ave spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears tha
t I am arrested."

"It may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no official agent. I understand that it wa
s your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, howe
ver."

"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I
 shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."

Holmes rose and sat down at the table
 with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the 
facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity t
o save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."

"It's as well," said t
he old man; "it's a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to sp
are Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not 
take me long to tell.

"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep 
you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life
. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.

"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap 
then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no 
luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were
 six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on th
e road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the co
lony as the Ballarat Gang.

"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it an
d attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles a
t the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of th
e wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though
 I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, becam
e wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determin
ed to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set
 myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and thoug
h my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me d
own the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for 
the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.

"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I 
met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.

" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touch
ing me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keepi
ng of us. If you don't--it's a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman within hail.'

"W
ell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my bes
t land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, g
rinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past th
an of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, hous
es, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.

"His son, you see, had grown up, and 
so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into
 the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any disl
ike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do 
his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.

"When I went down there I found hi
m talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to h
is talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with
 as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that 
I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was alread
y a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. Bu
t my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would d
o it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entan
gled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than i
f he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, tho
ugh I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, o
f all that occurred."

"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which h
ad been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."

"I pray not, sir. And what do you int
end to do?"

"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed
 at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to u
se it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe wit
h us."

"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the 
thought of the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly 
from the room.

"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless 
worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but for the grace 
of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.' "

James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objectio
ns which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after
 our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily to
gether in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.

ADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS


When I gla
nce over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
 present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some,
 however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qu
alities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some
, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others hav
e been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that 
absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its 
details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there 
are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.

The year '8
7 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headi
ngs under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant 
Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss 
of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and fi
nally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up 
the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone t
o bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may ske
tch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances wh
ich I have now taken up my pen to describe.

It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had se
t in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that ev
en here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of
 life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his c
ivilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried 
and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his r
ecords of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale 
from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea
 waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Ba
ker Street.

"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some fri
end of yours, perhaps?"

"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."

"A client, then?
"

"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it 
that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's."

Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, fo
r there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away fro
m himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

"Come in!" said he.

The man who entered was 
young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in
 his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce we
ather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his fac
e was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apolog
y," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought s
ome traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."

"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may r
est here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Horsham."


"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."

"I have come for advice."

"That 
is easily got."

"And help."

"That is not always so easy."

"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Pre
ndergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."

"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating a
t cards."

"He said that you could solve anything."

"He said too much."

"That you are never beaten."

"I have been 
beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman."

"But what is that compared with the number of your succ
esses?"

"It is true that I have been generally successful."

"Then you may be so with me."

"I beg that you will dra
w your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case."

"It is no ordinary one."

"None of tho
se which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal."

"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, 
you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own
 family."

"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I c
an afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important."

The young man pulled his chai
r up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.

"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, 
as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you
 an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.

"You must know that my grandfather had two 
sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time o
f the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such succ
ess that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.

"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when 
he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the 
war he fought in Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arm
s my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to 
Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and hi
s reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the 
franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a mo
st retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He h
ad a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for week
s on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no 
society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.

"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, 
for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had 
been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his wa
y. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his represen
tative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of
 the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in h
is privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, w
hich was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity
 I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles
 as would be expected in such a room.

"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the ta
ble in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all pai
d in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! W
hat can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his 
plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, 
his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trem
bling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'

" 'What is it, uncle?' I
 cried.

" 'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I 
took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times re
peated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left 
the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonge
d to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.

" 'They may do what they like, but
 I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send do
wn to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'

"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the 
room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, wh
ile the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid 
was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.

" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to
 witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, w
hence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my
 advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say
 what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'

"I signed the paper as dire
cted, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon
 me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could
 not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks pass
ed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He dran
k more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with
 the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of th
e house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that h
e was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would r
ush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against th
e terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with mo
isture, as though it were new raised from a basin.

"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to ab
use your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We fou
nd him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the ga
rden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his 
known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, 
had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father
 entered into possession of the estate, and of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."

"One moment," Hol
mes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have 
the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."

"The letter arrived on
 March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd."

"Thank you. Pray proceed."

"When my f
ather took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been alwa
ys locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was 
a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' wri
tten beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For
 the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearin
g upon my uncle's life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and ha
d borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and we
re mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians wh
o had been sent down from the North.

"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and 
all went as well as possible with us until the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father
 give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened en
velope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at wha
t he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing h
ad come upon himself.

" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.

"My heart had turned to lead. 'It 
is K. K. K.,' said I.

"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is 
this written above them?'

" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.

" 'What papers? Wha
t sundial?' he asked.

" 'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that a
re destroyed.'

" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have 
tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?'

" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.

" 
'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of s
uch nonsense.'

" 'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.

" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of th
e sort.'

" 'Then let me do so?'

" 'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'

"It was in vai
n to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodin
gs.

"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major F
reebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me
 that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of
 his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the
 deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him
, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fare
ham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in
 bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death
, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks
, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was fa
r from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.

"In this sinister way
 I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that
 our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressin
g in one house as in another.

"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight mont
hs have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse
 had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soo
n, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father."

The young man to
ok from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pip
s.

"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which 
were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the sundial.' "

"What have you done?" as
ked Holmes.

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt h
elpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp 
of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against."

"Tut! tut!" cried She
rlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."

"I
 have seen the police."

"Ah!"

"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has fo
rmed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents,
 as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings."

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "I
ncredible imbecility!" he cried.

"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."


"Has he come with you to-night?"

"No. His orders were to stay in the house."

Again Holmes raved in the air.

"Why 
did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"

"I did not know. It was only to-day t
hat I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you."

"It is really two days si
nce you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which yo
u have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?"

"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rum
maged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. 
"I have some remembrance," said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unbur
ned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his 
room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the ot
hers, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I thin
k myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."

Holmes moved the lamp, a
nd we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It
 was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:

"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform
.

"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and

        John Swain, of St. Augustine.

"9th. McCauley cleared.

"10
th. John Swain cleared.

"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."

"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and retu
rning it to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss w
hat you have told me. You must get home instantly and act."

"What shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It mu
st be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have descri
bed. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the onl
y one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you mus
t at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"

"Entirely."

"Do not think of revenge, 
or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave,
 while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The sec
ond is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."

"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pull
ing on his overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."

"Do not lose an in
stant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you 
are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?"

"By train from Waterloo."

"It is not yet ni
ne. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.
"

"I am armed."

"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."

"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"


"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it."

"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two
 days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands with us 
and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This stra
nge, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a 
gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.

Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head
 sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he
 watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "
that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this."

"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."

"Well, yes. Sa
ve, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos
."

"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?"

"There can be no question
 as to their nature," he answered.

"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy fa
mily?"

Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips togeth
er. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce 
from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As C
uvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thorough
ly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before an
d after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the stud
y which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to i
ts highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his kn
owledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these day
s of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a m
an should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my ca
se to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a ver
y precise fashion."

"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics we
re marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fif
ty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-
player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of m
y analysis."

Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep hi
s little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lum
ber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted
 to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Ency
clopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be de
duced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong 
reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charmin
g climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England sugge
sts the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear o
f someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by consider
ing the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those l
etters?"

"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London."

"From East London. Wh
at do you deduce from that?"

"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."

"Excellent. We have a
lready a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of
 a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat an
d its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"

"A greater distance to
 travel."

"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."

"Then I do not see the point."

"There is at least 
a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their si
ngular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign 
when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as th
eir letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference 
between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."

"It is possible."


"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw 
to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance.
 But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, 
this relentless persecution?"

"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or 
persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man co
uld not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it,
 and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who
 it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society."


"But of what society?"

"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you n
ever heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

"I never have."

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it 
is," said he presently:

" 'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocki
ng a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the 
Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, t
he Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the
 negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages wer
e usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of o
ak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjur
e his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him,
 and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic
 its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in whic
h any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of th
e efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the
 year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort sinc
e that date.'

"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society w
as coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effe
ct. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can underst
and that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who wil
l not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."

"Then the page we have seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. It ra
n, if I remember right, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to them. Then there are s
uccessive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister
 result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only ch
ance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done
 to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still mo
re miserable ways of our fellow men."

It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightne
ss through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.


"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into 
this case of young Openshaw's."

"What steps will you take?" I asked.

"It will very much depend upon the results of 
my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."

"You will not go there first?"

"No, I shall comme
nce with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee."

As I waited, I lifted the unopened ne
wspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.

"Holmes,
" I cried, "you are too late."

"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke cal
mly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Wa
terloo Bridge.' Here is the account:

" 'Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on
 duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark an
d stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm,
 however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of 
a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and wh
ose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Wat
erloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of t
he small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt tha
t the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention 
of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.' "

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes m
ore depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.

"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty fe
eling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shal
l set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--!" He
 sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and 
a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.

"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How 
could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt
, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. 
I am going out now!"

"To the police?"

"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the fli
es, but not before."

All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned
 to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale an
d worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down 
with a long draught of water.

"You are hungry," I remarked.

"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing
 since breakfast."

"Nothing?"

"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."

"And how have you succeeded?"

"Well."


"You have a clue?"

"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watso
n, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"

"What do you mean?"

He took an orang
e from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thru
st them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to 
"Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia."

"That will await him when he enters port," said he, ch
uckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before h
im."

"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"

"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."

"How did 
you trace it, then?"

He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.

"I have spen
t the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every 
vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which
 were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, alth
ough it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union
."

"Texas, I think."

"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin."

"Wh
at then?"

"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my s
uspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London."

"Yes?"


"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the 
river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passe
d some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from 
the Isle of Wight."

"What will you do, then?"

"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, t
he only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three a
way from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sa
iling-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police 
of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."

There is ever a flaw, however
, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which wou
ld show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe 
were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us.
 We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the
 trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of t
he Lone Star.

ADVENTURE  VI.  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP


Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., P
rincipal of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I unders
tand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams and sens
ations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many mor
e have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave 
to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty
 face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.

One night--it
 was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the cl
ock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.


"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."

I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard t
he door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad i
n some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, an
d then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her s
houlder. "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her vei
l, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in."

"I didn't know 
what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to
 a light-house.

"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably 
and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advic
e and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!"

It was not the fi
rst time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and schoo
l companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it 
possible that we could bring him back to her?

It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he h
ad, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had alway
s been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been
 upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or
 sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. B
ut what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband o
ut from among the ruffians who surrounded him?

There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Mi
ght I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's me
dical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my w
ord that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And
 so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on
 a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.

But t
here was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind th
e high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-sho
p, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of whi
ch I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless trea
d of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a 
long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of a
n emigrant ship.

Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed
 shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye tur
ned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, a
s the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themse
lves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then s
uddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neigh
bour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there s
at a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fir
e.

As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me t
o an empty berth.

"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, an
d I wish to speak with him."

There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I
 saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.

"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable st
ate of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"

"Nearly eleven."

"Of what day?
"

"Of Friday, June 19th."

"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a
 chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, man
. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mix
ed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with 
you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"

"Yes, I have one waiting."

"Th
en I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for mys
elf."

I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, s
tupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I fel
t a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look back at me." The words fell qui
te distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now 
as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as 
though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my s
elf-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see
 him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sittin
g by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to appr
oach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-
lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered
; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be
 exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you."

"I have a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may 
safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note 
by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with
 you in five minutes."

It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedin
gly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined 
in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be ass
ociated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few
 minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness
. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherl
ock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, h
e straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine 
that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured
 me with your medical views."

"I was certainly surprised to find you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."


"I came to find a friend."

"And I to find an enemy."

"An enemy?"

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say
, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue i
n the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would 
not have been worth an hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar wh
o runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of 
Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."

"What! Yo
u do not mean bodies?"

"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been 
done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has
 entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his teeth and wh
istled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of
 wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.

"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, 
throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"

"If I can 
be of use."

"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a doubl
e-bedded one."

"The Cedars?"

"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry."


"Where is it, then?"

"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."

"But I am all in the dark."

"Of c
ourse you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half 
a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!"

He flicked the horse with his w
hip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until
 we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay ano
ther dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, o
r the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a sta
r or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk u
pon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new q
uest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. 
We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook hi
mself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting 
for the best.

"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'P
on my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was w
ondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."

"You forget that I kno
w nothing about it."

"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurd
ly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end
 of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark whe
re all is dark to me."

"Proceed, then."

"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentlema
n, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very 
nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married th
e daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several co
mpanies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Cl
air is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a
 man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have be
en able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. 
There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.

"Last Monday Mr. Nevil
le St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissi
ons to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife rece
ived a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of conside
rable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if
 you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out
 of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some sho
pping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam L
ane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?"

"It is very clear."

"If you remember, Monday was 
an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not 
like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly 
heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, bec
koning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes a
s being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that 
it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struc
k her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neith
er collar nor necktie.

"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was no
ne other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascen
d the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom 
I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street.
 Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno S
treet a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied
 her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. S
t. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to 
be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly
 swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the insp
ector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang
 at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks
. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.

"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple s
howed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all poi
nted to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, whi
ch looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which 
is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a 
broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scat
tered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were al
l the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch-
-all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Ne
ville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominou
s bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very 
highest at the moment of the tragedy.

"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the mat
ter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to h
ave been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardl
y have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he 
had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presenc
e of the missing gentleman's clothes.

"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon t
he second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair
. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is
 a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. S
ome little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small an
gle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on h
is lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon
 the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional a
cquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, i
s so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a h
orrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of
 very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid 
the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff whi
ch may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den
, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."

"But a cripple!" said I. "What could 
he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?"

"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a l
imp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would te
ll you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."

"Pray con
tinue your narrative."

"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted h
ome in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, wh
o had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw a
ny light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minu
tes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was 
seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-sta
ins upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained t
hat the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which ha
d been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Cla
ir and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. S
t. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either
 mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the pre
mises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.

"And it did, though they hardly found upon the 
mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovere
d as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?"

"I cannot imagine."

"No, I don't think you
 would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder 
that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between t
he wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been s
ucked away into the river."

"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be d
ressed in a coat alone?"

"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thr
ust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then
? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, th
en, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little t
ime, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already hear
d from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rush
es to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which h
e can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the sa
me with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when 
the police appeared."

"It certainly sounds feasible."

"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a 
better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ev
er before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to h
ave been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved
--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh 
Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any ca
se within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."

While
 Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the
 great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon eit
her side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimm
ered in the windows.

"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties
 in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among
 the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doub
t, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Be
cause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my dispos
al, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her
, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large 
villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followe
d Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a littl
e blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiff
on at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one
 half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, 
a standing question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope w
hich sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"Non
e."

"No bad?"

"No."

"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day."

"This is m
y friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it poss
ible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation."

"I am delighted to see you," said she, pres
sing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you conside
r the blow which has come so suddenly upon us."

"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not 
I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I s
hall be indeed happy."

"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the tabl
e of which a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which 
I beg that you will give a plain answer."

"Certainly, madam."

"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterica
l, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."

"Upon what point?"

"In your heart of hear
ts, do you think that Neville is alive?"

Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" s
he repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

"Frankly, the
n, madam, I do not."

"You think that he is dead?"

"I do."

"Murdered?"

"I don't say that. Perhaps."

"And on what 
day did he meet his death?"

"On Monday."

"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is th
at I have received a letter from him to-day."

Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.


"What!" he roared.

"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.

"May I see it?"


"Certainly."

He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp a
nd examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse o
ne and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for i
t was considerably after midnight.

"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, ma
dam."

"No, but the enclosure is."

"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to 
the address."

"How can you tell that?"

"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The r
est is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and
 then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause be
fore he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but ther
e is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"

"Yes, there 
was a ring. His signet-ring."

"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"

"One of his hands."

"One?"

"Hi
s hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well."

" 'Dearest do not be f
rightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.
--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesen
d by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had 
been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words
."

"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture 
to say that the danger is over."

"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on 
the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him."

"No, no; it is, it is his ve
ry own writing!"

"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day."

"That is possibl
e."

"If so, much may have happened between."

"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well w
ith him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw 
him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certai
nty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?
"

"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an an
alytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. Bu
t if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"

"I cannot imagine. It is 
unthinkable."

"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"

"No."

"And you were surprised to see him in S
wandam Lane?"

"Very much so."

"Was the window open?"

"Yes."

"Then he might have called to you?"

"He might."

"He
 only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"

"Yes."

"A call for help, you thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hands
."

"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw u
p his hands?"

"It is possible."

"And you thought he was pulled back?"

"He disappeared so suddenly."

"He might hav
e leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?"

"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, 
and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."

"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary cl
othes on?"

"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat."

"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"


"Never."

"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"

"Never."

"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are th
e principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, fo
r we may have a very busy day to-morrow."

A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal
, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, howev
er, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning
 it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced 
himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting
. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting 
pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upo
n which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.
 In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly up
on the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his
 strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
 to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke st
ill curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I ha
d seen upon the previous night.

"Awake, Watson?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Game for a morning drive?"

"Certainly."

"Then
 dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He chuc
kled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous n
ight.

As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past
 four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.

"I want to te
st a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presen
ce of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have
 the key of the affair now."

"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.

"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am no
t joking," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have 
got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."

We made our way d
ownstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, wit
h the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few cou
ntry carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as sil
ent and lifeless as some city in a dream.

"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the ho
rse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than neve
r to learn it at all."

In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we dro
ve through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashi
ng up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well know
n to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led
 us in.

"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.

"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout 
official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word wi
th you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge l
edger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.

"What can I do f
or you, Mr. Holmes?"

"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disa
ppearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."

"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."

"So I hea
rd. You have him here?"

"In the cells."

"Is he quiet?"

"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."

"D
irty?"

"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once
 his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me 
that he needed it."

"I should like to see him very much."

"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can l
eave your bag."

"No, I think that I'll take it."

"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passag
e, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors o
n each side.

"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the 
upper part of the door and glanced through.

"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."

We both put our e
yes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He
 was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in hi
s tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not c
onceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contra
ction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very
 bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.

"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.

"He certainly 
needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." 
He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"He! he! You ar
e a funny one," chuckled the inspector.

"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we
 will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."

"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn
't look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered
 the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-
jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.

"Let me introduc
e you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent."

Never in my life have I seen such a s
ight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too
, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face
! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-lookin
g man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenl
y realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.

"Great heavens!
" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph."

The prisoner turned with th
e reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"


"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempt
ed suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this reall
y takes the cake."

"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, th
erefore, I am illegally detained."

"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would ha
ve done better to have trusted you wife."

"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God hel
p me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"

Sherlock Holmes sat d
own beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.

"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the m
atter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorit
ies that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find t
heir way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and
 submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all."

"God bless you!" cried the pr
isoner passionately. "I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secre
t as a family blot to my children.

"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in 
Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became
 a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the 
metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only b
y trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of cou
rse, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now o
f my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side
 of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appr
opriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a begga
r. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had receiv
ed no less than 26s. 4d.

"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed
 a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for $25. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudde
n idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent t
he time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.

"Well, you can 
imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by
 smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my
 pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which
 I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secr
et. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a 
squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was we
ll paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.

"Well, very soon I found that
 I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a ye
ar--which is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a f
acility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a strea
m of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take $2.

"As I gre
w richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicio
n as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.

"Last Monday I 
had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to m
y horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of
 surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyo
ne from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my c
lothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete 
a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me
. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that
 morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leathe
r bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clo
thes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I f
ound, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as h
is murderer.

"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise 
as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slip
ped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried 
scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."

"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.

"Good God!
 What a week she must have spent!"

"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quit
e understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor custom
er of his, who forgot all about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
 of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop her
e, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."

"I hav
e sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."

"In that case I think that it is probable that no further
 steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much
 indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."

"I reached this one," 
said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Ba
ker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

VII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE


I had called upon my
 friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of
 the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, an
d a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and 
on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in se
veral places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this
 manner for the purpose of examination.

"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."

"Not at all. I am gla
d to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in
 the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest 
and even of instruction."

I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp
 frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it loo
ks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of som
e mystery and the punishment of some crime."

"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those 
whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within t
he space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combinat
ion of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bi
zarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such."

"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last s
ix cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime."

"Precisely. You allude t
o my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of
 the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"

"Yes."

"It is to him that this trophy belongs."

"It is his hat."

"No, n
o, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellec
tual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose
, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'c
lock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollifi
cation and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish 
man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of G
oodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the ma
n's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behin
d him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken
 the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his hee
ls, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had al
so fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoi
ls of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."

"Which surely he restored
 to their owner?"

"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a
 small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the
 lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of our
s, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them."

"What, then, did Peterson do?"

"He brought round bo
th hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose
 we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it s
hould be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of
 a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner."

"Did he not ad
vertise?"

"No."

"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"

"Only as much as we can deduce."

"From his h
at?"

"Precisely."

"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?"

"Here is my lens. You kno
w my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?"

I took the
 tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round 
shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was 
no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the
 brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in
 several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them wit
h ink.

"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.

"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything.
 You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."

"Then, pray tell me 
what it is that you can infer from this hat?"

He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion 
which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there
 are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probabil
ity. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-
to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than
 formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate s
ome evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ce
ased to love him."

"My dear Holmes!"

"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disrega
rding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is midd
le-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These
 are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable th
at he has gas laid on in his house."

"You are certainly joking, Holmes."

"Not in the least. Is it possible that eve
n now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"

"I have no doubt that I am very 
stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellec
tual?"

For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge 
of his nose. "It is a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a brain must have something in it."


"The decline of his fortunes, then?"

"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then
. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could a
fford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the wor
ld."

"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"

Sherlock Hol
mes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "T
hey are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went o
ut of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not t
roubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a wea
kening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them wi
th ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."

"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."

"
The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he use
s lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a l
arge number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a dis
tinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy bro
wn dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the
 inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of train
ing."

"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."

"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I se
e you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in s
uch a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."

"But he might b
e a bachelor."

"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird
's leg."

"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?
"

"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be 
little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night p
robably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-j
et. Are you satisfied?"

"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has 
been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."


Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into
 the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.

"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The
 goose, sir!" he gasped.

"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?"
 Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.

"See here, sir! See what
 my wife found in its crop!" He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillati
ng blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric 
point in the dark hollow of his hand.

Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is 
treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?"

"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass 
as though it were putty."

"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."

"Not the Countess of Morcar'
s blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.

"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the adve
rtisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but
 the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."

"A thousand pounds! Grea
t Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.

"That is the 
reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the 
Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem."

"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the
 Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.

"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was a
ccused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has b
een referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, gla
ncing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:

"Hotel C
osmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., ab
stracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upp
er-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Co
untess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loo
se. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horne
r had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards
 transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly 
gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or 
in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering th
e robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Br
adstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocenc
e in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the m
agistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of 
intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."

"Hum! So much 
for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the se
quence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the ot
her. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Her
e is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad ha
t and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to findi
ng this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simple
st means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have r
ecourse to other methods."

"What will you say?"

"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the 
corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this eve
ning at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."

"Very. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an e
ye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaki
ng the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitt
erly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause hi
m to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the adve
rtising agency and have this put in the evening papers."

"In which, sir?"

"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. J
ames's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."

"Very well, sir. And this stone?"

"Ah, yes
, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with m
e, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."

When the 
commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just
 see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devi
l's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty y
ears old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteris
tic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sini
ster history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the
 sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor t
o the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we hav
e it."

"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"

"I cannot tell."

"Well, then, do you imagine that this oth
er one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?"

"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an a
bsolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it
 were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertis
ement."

"And you can do nothing until then?"

"Nothing."

"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But 
I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled 
a business."

"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent o
ccurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."

I had been delayed at a case, and it was a litt
le after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a
 Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was throw
n from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.

"Mr. Henr
y Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which 
he could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your
 circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that yo
ur hat, Mr. Baker?"

"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."

He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive he
ad, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and chee
ks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat 
was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a s
ign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression gene
rally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.

"We have retained these things
 for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a lo
ss to know now why you did not advertise."

Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so p
lentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carrie
d off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."

"Very 
naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his cha
ir in his excitement.

"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other
 goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?
"

"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.

"Of course, we still have the feathers, leg
s, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"

The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to m
e as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acqu
aintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the exce
llent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard."

Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of
 his shoulders.

"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me w
here you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose."

"Cer
tainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us wh
o frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. Th
is year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every
 week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am mu
ch indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity 
of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.

"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes wh
en he had closed the door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you h
ungry, Watson?"

"Not particularly."

"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue w
hile it is still hot."

"By all means."

It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about o
ur throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into
 smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,
 Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in 
Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into H
olborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-ap
roned landlord.

"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.

"My geese!" The man seemed
 surprised.

"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."

"A
h! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."

"Indeed! Whose, then?"

"Well, I got the two dozen from a sa
lesman in Covent Garden."

"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"

"Breckinridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't kn
ow him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night."

"Now for Mr. Breckinridge
," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so h
omely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' pen
al servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, i
n any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has plac
ed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!"

We passed acros
s Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bo
re the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whisker
s was helping a boy to put up the shutters.

"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.

The salesman nodded and
 shot a questioning glance at my companion.

"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs
 of marble.

"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."

"That's no good."

"Well, there are some on the stall wi
th the gas-flare."

"Ah, but I was recommended to you."

"Who by?"

"The landlord of the Alpha."

"Oh, yes; I sent hi
m a couple of dozen."

"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"

To my surprise the question pro
voked a burst of anger from the salesman.

"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "w
hat are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."

"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
 geese which you supplied to the Alpha."

"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"

"Oh, it is a matter of no importan
ce; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle."

"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as p
estered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are
 the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were t
he only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them."

"Well, I have no connection with any other peo
ple who have been making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I
'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred
."

"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped the salesman.

"It's nothing of the kind."

"I 
say it is."

"I don't believe it."

"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I
 was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred."

"You'll never persuade me to beli
eve that."

"Will you bet, then?"

"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovere
ign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate."

The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," s
aid he.

The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together bene
ath the hanging lamp.

"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I 
finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"

"Well?"

"That's the list of 
the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their 
names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a 
list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me."

"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road-
-249," read Holmes.

"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."

Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are,
 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.' "

"Now, then, what's the last entry?"

" 'December 22
nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "

"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"

" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alph
a, at 12s.' "

"What have you to say now?"

Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his poc
ket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few ya
rds off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.

"When y
ou see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a 
bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete
 information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearin
g the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oak
shott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that ther
e are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"

His remarks were suddenly cut short
 by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fell
ow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, th
e salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.

"I've had enough
 of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more wi
th your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do
 with it? Did I buy the geese off you?"

"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man.

"Well, 
then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."

"She told me to ask you."

"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. 
I've had enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.


"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made
 of this fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion s
peedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light 
that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.

"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a qua
vering voice.

"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing the questions which you p
ut to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you."

"You? Who are you? How could you know an
ything of the matter?"

"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know."

"But y
ou can know nothing of this?"

"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which we
re sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the 
Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member."

"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have lon
ged to meet," cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how
 interested I am in this matter."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had bett
er discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go f
arther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."

The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinso
n," he answered with a sidelong glance.

"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing bu
siness with an alias."

A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is Ja
mes Ryder."

"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be abl
e to tell you everything which you would wish to know."

The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us wi
th half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catast
rophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing ha
d been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of
 his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.

"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. 
"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just pu
t on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese
?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, 
with a black bar across the tail."

Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went 
to?"

"It came here."

"Here?"

"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an in
terest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it
 here in my museum."

Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlo
cked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed
 radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"The game's up, Ryder,
" said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's n
ot got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more huma
n. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"

For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge
 of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.

"I have almost every link in my 
hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little 
may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morc
ar's?"

"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a crackling voice.

"I see--her ladyship's waiting-ma
id. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men befo
re you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a 
very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before
, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady'
s room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, 
you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--"

Ryder threw himself 
down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of
 my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'l
l swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Ho
lmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock
 for a crime of which he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge agai
nst him will break down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How cam
e the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only 
hope of safety."

Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said 
he. "When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, 
for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was n
o place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's hous
e. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the 
way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the s
weat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I wa
s so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and
 smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, 
and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieve
s, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things ab
out him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would sh
ow me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through 
in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat 
pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, 
and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.

"My sist
er had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she
 was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a 
little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caugh
t it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a g
ulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and o
ut came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off am
ong the others.

" 'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give m
e one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.'

" 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem
's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one
 for us, and two dozen for the market.'

" 'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather
 have that one I was handling just now.'

" 'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it 
expressly for you.'

" 'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.

" 'Oh, just as you like,' sa
id she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you want, then?'

" 'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle o
f the flock.'

" 'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'

"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carrie
d the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing l
ike that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there
 was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sis
ter's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.

" 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I crie
d.

" 'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'

" 'Which dealer's?'

" 'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'

" 'But was there anothe
r with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'

" 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I
 could never tell them apart.'

"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me 
to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gon
e. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad
. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the w
ealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face burie
d in his hands.

There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock
 Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.

"Get out!" said he.

"
What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"

"No more words. Get out!"

And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clat
ter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.

"After all, Wats
on," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their deficienci
es. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case mus
t collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will
 not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besi
des, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its soluti
on is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, i
n which, also a bird will be the chief feature."

VIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND


On glancing over my not
es of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Hol
mes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rath
er for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
 which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall 
any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Ro
ylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were 
sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a pr
omise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death 
of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have r
easons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matte
r even more terrible than the truth.

It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock 
Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel
piece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a littl
e resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.

"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the co
mmon lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."

"What is it, then--a fi
re?"

"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon s
eeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of 
the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they ha
ve to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset
. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."

"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for 
anything."

I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the
 rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the pro
blems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my frien
d down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as w
e entered.

"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and 
associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson ha
s had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe 
that you are shivering."

"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as
 requested.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could se
e that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, l
ike those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with 
premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-com
prehensive glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon
 set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but 
I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you
 had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."

The lady gave a violent start a
nd stared in bewilderment at my companion.

"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of 
your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle sa
ve a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"Wha
tever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead
 at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad i
f it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of littl
e aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her s
ore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at leas
t throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you 
for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at lea
st you shall not find me ungrateful."

Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which
 he consulted.

"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was
 before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did
 to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever exp
enses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that ma
y help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."

"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies
 in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem tri
vial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I 
tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers 
and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human hea
rt. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."

"I am all attention, madam."

"My name is He
len Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in Engla
nd, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."

Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to 
me," said he.

"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders in
to Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a d
issolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regen
cy. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a 
heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; 
but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a 
relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and h
is force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which ha
d been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it wa
s, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.

"When D
r. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Art
illery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She 
had a considerable sum of money--not less than $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we
 resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our mar
riage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near 
Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with hi
m in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and the
re seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Inste
ad of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of S
toke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in feroci
ous quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the me
n of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics
. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terr
or of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncon
trollable in his anger.

"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by p
aying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no fr
iends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bram
ble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wander
ing away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him b
y a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are fea
red by the villagers almost as much as their master.

"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and 
I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the h
ouse. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."


"Your sister is dead, then?"

"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You c
an understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and po
sition. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we we
re occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and me
t there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sist
er returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the 
wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."

Sherlock Holmes had been leaning b
ack in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced acr
oss at his visitor.

"Pray be precise as to details," said he.

"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that 
dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is no
w inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the b
uildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is no com
munication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"

"Perfectly so."

"Th
e windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though 
we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it
 was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting abo
ut her approaching wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.

" 'T
ell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'

" 'Never,' said I.

" 'I su
ppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'

" 'Certainly not. But why?'

" 'Because during 
the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and 
it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought th
at I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'

" 'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plant
ation.'

" 'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'

" 'Ah, but I sleep
 more heavily than you.'

" 'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door
, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."

"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lo
ck yourselves in at night?"

"Always."

"And why?"

"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah a
nd a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."

"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statemen
t."

"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will r
ecollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was 
a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, ami
d all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's 
voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to 
hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had 
fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it
 horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appe
ar at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro lik
e that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and s
he fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first 
I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall n
ever forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain h
ave said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion 
seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his roo
m in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her th
roat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having
 recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."

"One moment," said Holmes, "are you s
ure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"

"That was what the county coroner asked me at the
 inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old
 house, I may possibly have been deceived."

"Was your sister dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her righ
t hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."

"Showing that she had struck a light an
d looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"

"He 
investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was un
able to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side,
 and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The wal
ls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined,
 with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my
 sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."

"How about poi
son?"

"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."

"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of
, then?"

"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I can
not imagine."

"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"

"Yes, there are nearly always some there."

"Ah, 
and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"

"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely
 the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies
 in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might
 have suggested the strange adjective which she used."

Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisf
ied.

"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative."

"Two years have passed since then, an
d my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many y
ears, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. 
Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be marrie
d in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroo
m wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the ver
y bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terri
ble fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I 
sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so 
I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and dro
ve to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."


"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me all?"

"Yes, all."

"Miss Roylott, you have not. You 
are screening your stepfather."

"Why, what do you mean?"

For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace whic
h fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, 
were printed upon the white wrist.

"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.

The lady coloured deeply and covered 
over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."

There was a lo
ng silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.

"This is a very d
eep business," he said at last. "There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our 
course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible fo
r us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"

"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town
 to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothi
ng to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."


"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"

"By no means."

"Then we shall both come. What are you going
 to do yourself?"

"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by th
e twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."

"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I
 have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"

"No, I must go. My heart is
 lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon."
 She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.

"And what do you think of it all, Watson?"
 asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.

"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."

"Dark 
enough and sinister enough."

"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that t
he door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her myster
ious end."

"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?
"

"I cannot think."

"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on 
intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in
 preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner 
heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling bac
k into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."

"Bu
t what, then, did the gipsies do?"

"I cannot imagine."

"I see many objections to any such theory."

"And so do I. I
t is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fa
tal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!"

The ejaculation had been drawn from my co
mpanion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the apertu
re. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long fr
ock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually 
brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seare
d with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to th
e other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resembla
nce to a fierce old bird of prey.

"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.

"My name, sir; but you have the 
advantage of me," said my companion quietly.

"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."

"Indeed, Doctor," said Ho
lmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."

"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. 
What has she been saying to you?"

"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.

"What has she been s
aying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.

"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my compa
nion imperturbably.

"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his huntin
g-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."

My friend smiled.

"Ho
lmes, the busybody!"

His smile broadened.

"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"

Holmes chuckled heartily. "Y
our conversation is most entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."

"
I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I
 traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent 
it into a curve with his huge brown hands.

"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the 
twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.

"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing.
 "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than h
is own." As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.

"Fancy his h
aving the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, 
however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace 
her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to
 get some data which may help us in this matter."

It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his e
xcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.

"I have seen the will of 
the deceased wife," said he. "To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of th
e investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of
 $1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $25
0, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere p
ittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, si
nce it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Wa
tson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his a
ffairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would sl
ip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers
 into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."

At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a tra
in for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surr
ey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedge
s were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To 
me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which w
e were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and hi
s chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder,
 and pointed over the meadows.

"Look there!" said he.

A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thick
ening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree o
f a very old mansion.

"Stoke Moran?" said he.

"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the d
river.

"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."

"There's the village," s
aid the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'l
l find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is wal
king."

"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as
 you suggest."

We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.

"I thought it as wel
l," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some de
finite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."


Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so e
agerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to tow
n, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."

"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquain
tance," said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as sh
e listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never
 know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"

"He must guard himself, for he may find that there
 is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, 
we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at onc
e to the rooms which we are to examine."

The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portio
n and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were br
oken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was i
n little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the bl
ue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erect
ed against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the momen
t of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides o
f the windows.

"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, an
d the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"

"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.
"

"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repair
s at that end wall."

"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."

"Ah! that is sugge
stive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are wind
ows in it, of course?"

"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."

"As you both locked your 
doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room 
and bar your shutters?"

Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavo
ured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be pa
ssed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the ma
ssive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficultie
s. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the m
atter."

A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to 
examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in whi
ch her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after th
e fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in ano
ther, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, ma
de up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panell
ing of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original build
ing of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and roun
d and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.

"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at las
t pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.

"It goes 
to the housekeeper's room."

"It looks newer than the other things?"

"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years a
go."

"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"

"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wante
d for ourselves."

"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minu
tes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawl
ed swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood
-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
 in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, i
t's a dummy," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can s
ee now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."

"How very absurd! I
 never noticed that before."

"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singul
ar points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, w
ith the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"

"That is also quite modern," said the lady.


"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.

"Yes, there were several little changes carried out a
bout that time."

"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do
 not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."

Dr. 
Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a sma
ll wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair agai
nst the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly 
round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.

"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.

"M
y stepfather's business papers."

"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"

"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it w
as full of papers."

"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"

"No. What a strange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He to
ok up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.

"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a ba
boon."

"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in sati
sfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He squatted down in front of the w
ooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.

"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, ri
sing and putting his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"

The object which had caught his eye
 was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make
 a loop of whipcord.

"What do you make of that, Watson?"

"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should
 be tied."

"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains 
to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall 
walk out upon the lawn."

I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from
 the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself li
king to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.

"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," s
aid he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."

"I shall most certainly do so."

"The matter
 is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance."

"I assure you that I am in your hand
s."

"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."

Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at h
im in astonishment.

"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?"

"Yes, 
that is the Crown."

"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"

"Certainly."

"You must confine yourself
 to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the nigh
t, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw
 quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, i
n spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."

"Oh, yes, easily."

"The rest you will leave in our h
ands."

"But what will you do?"

"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this n
oise which has disturbed you."

"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, l
aying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.

"Perhaps I have."

"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of 
my sister's death."

"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."

"You can at least tell me whether my o
wn thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."

"No, I do not think so. I think that there was prob
ably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our jou
rney would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we 
shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."

Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom 
and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the a
venue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his
 huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoin
g the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his c
linched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as t
he lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.

"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering 
darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."

"Can I be 
of assistance?"

"Your presence might be invaluable."

"Then I shall certainly come."

"It is very kind of you."

"Yo
u speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."

"No, but I fancy that I may 
have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did."

"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, an
d what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."

"You saw the ventilator, too?"

"Yes, but I 
do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a r
at could hardly pass through."

"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."

"My de
ar Holmes!"

"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar.
 Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a s
mall one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."

"But what harm can 
there be in that?"

"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, an
d a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"

"I cannot as yet see any connection."

"Did you obse
rve anything very peculiar about that bed?"

"No."

"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened lik
e that before?"

"I cannot say that I have."

"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relativ
e position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.
"

"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle a
nd horrible crime."

"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He
 has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even
 deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before t
he night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more ch
eerful."

About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Man
or House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone
 out right in front of us.

"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle windo
w."

As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an
 acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark r
oad, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us o
n our sombre errand.

There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old p
ark wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window
 when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itsel
f upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.

"My God!" I whispered; 
"did you see it?"

Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agita
tion. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.

"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the
 baboon."

I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might fin
d it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example 
and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the
 lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to
 me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to dis
tinguish the words:

"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."

I nodded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit
 without light. He would see it through the ventilator."

I nodded again.

"Do not go asleep; your very life may depe
nd upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chai
r."

I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this
 he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down t
he lamp, and we were left in darkness.

How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not ev
en the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same stat
e of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute da
rkness.

From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine
, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, wh
ich boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and thr
ee, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.

Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light u
p in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil 
and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all w
as silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly anothe
r sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a 
kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane 
at the bell-pull.

"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"

But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struc
k the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me 
to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and fi
lled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke 
from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a
 hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the villag
e, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and
 I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it ros
e.

"What can it mean?" I gasped.

"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is fo
r the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the w
ay down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle an
d entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the tab
le stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door o
f which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown,
 his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the s
hort stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed
 in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish
 speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The ban
d! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, an
d there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"It 
is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Viole
nce does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thr
ust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county p
olice know what has happened."

As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the no
ose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iro
n safe, which he closed upon it.

Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is
 not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke 
the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, 
of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly pl
aying with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we trav
elled back next day.

"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how da
ngerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' w
hich was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the 
light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instant
ly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the r
oom could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to
 you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and t
hat the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for so
mething passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coup
led it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was proba
bly on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical tes
t was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with 
which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed c
oroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done 
their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to
 the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He woul
d put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the ro
pe and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
 sooner or later she must fall a victim.

"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An ins
pection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in
 order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were 
enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously ca
used by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, 
you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt
 that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."

"With the result of driving it through the venti
lator."

"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my c
ane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt 
indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upo
n my conscience."

IX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB


Of all the problems which have been submitted to my f
riend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means 
of introducing to his notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these the la
tter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inceptio
n and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my frien
d fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has
, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less strik
ing when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, a
nd the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At 
the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the
 effect.

It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to s
ummarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I con
tinually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us.
 My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I g
ot a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was ne
ver weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any infl
uence.

One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce tha
t two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experi
ence that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came ou
t of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.

"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his 
shoulder; "he's all right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature 
which he had caged up in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he
 couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.
" And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and foun
d a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he h
ad laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with blo
odstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceed
ingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his st
rength of mind to control.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious ac
cident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a d
octor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the 
side-table."

I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd fl
oor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you waiting," said I, si
tting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous oc
cupation."

"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a hig
h, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh
.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however
. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and 
gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.

"I have been making a fool of myself," he
 gasped.

"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his blo
odless cheeks.

"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to
 the place where my thumb used to be."

He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened n
erves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb sh
ould have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible in
jury. It must have bled considerably."

"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been s
enseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief ver
y tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."

"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."

"It is a ques
tion of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province."

"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "b
y a very heavy and sharp instrument."

"A thing like a cleaver," said he.

"An accident, I presume?"

"By no means."


"What! a murderous attack?"

"Very murderous indeed."

"You horrify me."

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed i
t, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bi
t his lip from time to time.

"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.

"Capital! Between your brandy and your ban
dage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."

"Perhaps you had better not spea
k of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves."

"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the polic
e; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if
 they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which t
o back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whethe
r justice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved
, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police."


"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, th
ough of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I
'll take you round to him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged to you."

"We'll call a cab and go together. We sh
all just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until
 I have told my story."

"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs,
 explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance t
o Baker Street.

Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading th
e agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles le
ft from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received
 us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was conclu
ded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and w
ater within his reach.

"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pra
y, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up
 your strength with a little stimulant."

"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor
 bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time
 as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."

Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary,
 heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in sile
nce to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.

"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bach
elor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable expe
rience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwi
ch. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's deat
h, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.

"I suppose that e
veryone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During
 two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brough
t me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited i
n my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at
 all.

"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentlem
an waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' e
ngraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding 
thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and t
he skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural 
habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but nea
tly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.

" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with someth
ing of a German accent. 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in
 his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.'

"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any youn
g man would at such an address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'

" 'Well, perhaps it is bette
r that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and
 a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'

" 'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I s
ay that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a profession
al matter that you wished to speak to me?'

" 'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the poin
t. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understan
d, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'


" 'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'

"He looked very hard at m
e as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

" 'Do you promise, the
n?' said he at last.

" 'Yes, I promise.'

" 'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference t
o the matter at all, either in word or writing?'

" 'I have already given you my word.'

" 'Very good.' He suddenly s
prang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.

" 'That'
s all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we ca
n talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning a
nd thoughtful look.

"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strang
e antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.

"
 'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sente
nce, but the words came to my lips.

" 'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.

" 'Most admi
rably.'

" 'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydrauli
c stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What
 do you think of such a commission as that?'

" 'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'

" 'Precisely 
so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.'

" 'Where to?'

" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little
 place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which wou
ld bring you there at about 11:15.'

" 'Very good.'

" 'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'

" 'There is a 
drive, then?'

" 'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'


" 'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be comp
elled to stop the night.'

" 'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'

" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come
 at some more convenient hour?'

" 'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any
 inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very hea
ds of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do
 so.'

"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be
 very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it
 is that you wish me to do.'

" 'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from y
ou should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid befor
e you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'

" 'Entirely.'

" 'Then the matter stands thus. You
 are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in Engl
and?'

" 'I have heard so.'

" 'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of 
Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. On examin
ing it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very 
much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people w
ere absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was 
to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I
 could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and se
cretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the nei
ghbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a h
ydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subje
ct. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming t
o our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance 
of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a h
uman being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'

" 'I quite follow you,' said I. 
'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating ful
ler's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.'

" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our ow
n process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mer
e detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He ros
e as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'

" 'I shall certainly be there.'

" 'And not a word to
 a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hu
rried from the room.

"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may bo
th think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the f
ee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that thi
s order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impressi
on upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity 
for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears
 to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction 
as to holding my tongue.

"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for
 the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger wh
o got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out t
hrough the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Wi
thout a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the wi
ndows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."

"One horse?" interje
cted Holmes.

"Yes, only one."

"Did you observe the colour?"

"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping 
into the carriage. It was a chestnut."

"Tired-looking or fresh?"

"Oh, fresh and glossy."

"Thank you. I am sorry to
 have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement."

"Away we went then, and we drove for at least
 an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we see
med to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the
 time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensit
y. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried 
to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make o
ut nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monot
ony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, howev
er, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stan
d. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in fro
nt of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fle
eting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind 
us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.

"It was pitch dark inside the house, an
d the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other e
nd of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared w
ith a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that s
he was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. 
She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a 
gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whisp
ered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me ag
ain with the lamp in his hand.

" 'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said h
e, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on w
hich several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door.
 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished into the darkness.

"I glanced at the books upon th
e table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others be
ing volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side
, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock
 ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness be
gan to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way p
lace? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east
, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the pl
ace might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the c
ountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was tho
roughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.

"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, t
he door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, th
e yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
 fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she sh
ot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the 
gloom behind her.

" 'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should 
not stay here. There is no good for you to do.'

" 'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cann
ot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'

" 'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass
 through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her co
nstraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away f
rom here before it is too late!'

"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair 
when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleas
ant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried 
out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With 
a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and d
eclared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, an
d the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a de
spairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.

"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander 
Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced
 to me as Mr. Ferguson.

" 'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impress
ion that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'

" 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I ope
ned the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.'

"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perh
aps we had better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.'

" '
I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'

" 'Oh, no, it is in the house.'

" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the hous
e?'

" 'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machi
ne and to let us know what is wrong with it.'

"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat m
anager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and
 little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no c
arpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the dam
p was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had n
ot forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. 
Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a 
fellow-countryman.

"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small,
 square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel usher
ed me in.

" 'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant t
hing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending pisto
n, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outs
ide which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine g
oes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps 
you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.'

"I took the lamp from him, and I
 examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. Whe
n I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound th
at there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examinati
on showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to 
fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my co
mpanions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed 
to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look
 at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fa
brication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose
. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a
 crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I hear
d a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.

" 'What are you do
ing there?' he asked.

"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I 
was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if 
I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'

"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rash
ness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.

" 'Very well,' said he, 'you s
hall know all about the machine.' He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I
 rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and s
hoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'

"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent
 my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine 
at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that
 the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which
 must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my 
nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries.
 The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Th
en it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. I
f I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the ot
her way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Alre
ady I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.

"I have
 said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around,
 I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was push
ed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next in
stant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but th
e crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my
 escape.

"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor 
of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her 
right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.

" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly
. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but co
me!'

"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor an
d down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of runn
ing feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one ben
eath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led in
to a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.

" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It i
s high, but it may be that you can jump it.'

"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passag
e, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
 butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sw
eet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out
 upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who 
pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had ha
rdly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him an
d tried to hold him back.

" 'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You sa
id it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'

" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling
 to break away from her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one
 side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands
 to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.


"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could ru
n, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and 
sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw th
at my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round
 it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.

"How 
long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright mo
rning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with b
lood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, an
d I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when
 I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close b
y the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the ver
y station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had p
assed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.

"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked abou
t the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had
 been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was stran
ge to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station any
where near? There was one about three miles off.

"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined t
o wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I 
went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into 
your hands and shall do exactly what you advise."

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to thi
s extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in 
which he placed his cuttings.

"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the p
apers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic e
ngineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! 
That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."

"Good heavens!" crie
d my patient. "Then that explains what the girl said."

"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool a
nd desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those o
ut-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you fee
l equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."

Some three hours o
r so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were She
rlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradst
reet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with
 Eyford for its centre.

"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. T
he place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."

"It was an hour's good drive."


"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?"

"They must have done so. I have
 a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."

"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why 
they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the
 woman's entreaties."

"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."

"Oh, we shall so
on clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it t
he folk that we are in search of are to be found."

"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.

"Rea
lly, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it 
is south, for the country is more deserted there."

"And I say east," said my patient.

"I am for west," remarked the
 plain-clothes man. "There are several quiet little villages up there."

"And I am for north," said I, "because there
 are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any."

"Come," cried the inspector
, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your castin
g vote to?"

"You are all wrong."

"But we can't all be."

"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger
 in the centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."

"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.

"S
ix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could
 it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"

"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
 thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."

"None at all," said Holmes. "They ar
e coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."

"We 
have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns
 by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces 
in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got th
em right enough."

But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of ju
stice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump
 of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.

"A house on fire?" asked
 Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.

"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.

"When did it break out?
"

"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house
 is it?"

"Dr. Becher's."

"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp n
ose?"

The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the paris
h who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a for
eigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."

The station-master had not finished h
is speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a grea
t widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in fro
nt three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.

"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excite
ment. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jum
ped from."

"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was
 your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too e
xcited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of la
st night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now."

And Holmes' fears came to be reali
sed, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the
 morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes d
riving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingen
uity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.

The firemen had been much perturbed at the stra
nge arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a win
dow-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flam
es, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twi
sted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so 
dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, whic
h may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.

How our hydraulic engine
er had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery 
were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, o
ne of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the 
silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscio
us man out of the way of danger.

"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to Lond
on, "it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I g
ained?"

"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into 
words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence."

X.  THE ADVENTURE OF T
HE NOBLE BACHELOR


The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of int
erest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their 
more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however,
 that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considera
ble share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of thi
s remarkable episode.

It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with
 Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I 
had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jeza
il bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until a
t last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and mon
ogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.

"Here is a
 very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered. "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-mo
nger and a tide-waiter."

"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the
 humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a 
man either to be bored or to lie."

He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

"Oh, come, it may prove to be s
omething of interest, after all."

"Not social, then?"

"No, distinctly professional."

"And from a noble client?"

"
One of the highest in England."

"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."

"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, t
hat the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, howe
ver, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late
, have you not?"

"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing e
lse to do."

"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news an
d the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have
 read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"

"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."

"That is well. The letter which 
I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and le
t me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:

" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tell
s me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon
 you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. 
Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-o
peration, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, 
and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramo
unt importance. Yours faithfully,


" 'ST. SIMON.'

"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, a
nd the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remar
ked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.

"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."

"Then 
I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extract
s in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line 
of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee
. " 'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops
 in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secr
etary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
 They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very ins
tructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid."

"I have very little difficu
lty in finding what I want," said I, "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feare
d to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of oth
er matters."

"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--t
hough, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."

"Here is the f
irst notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks bac
k: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Ro
bert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., 
of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."

"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin l
egs towards the fire.

"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here
 it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appear
s to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing
 into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last wee
k to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown hims
elf for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriag
e with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and 
striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently repor
ted that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open 
secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. S
imon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not
 the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady t
o a British peeress.' "

"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.

"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the
 Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Sq
uare, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished hous
e at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is 
a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's plac
e, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."

"Before the wh
at?" asked Holmes with a start.

"The vanishing of the lady."

"When did she vanish, then?"

"At the wedding breakfas
t."

"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."

"Yes; it struck me as being
 a little out of the common."

"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I c
annot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details."

"I warn you that they are very i
ncomplete."

"Perhaps we may make them less so."

"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morn
ing paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':

" 'T
he family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episode
s which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterda
y, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours whic
h have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much pu
blic attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common
 subject for conversation.

" 'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet on
e, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lo
rd Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. 
The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been 
prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavo
ured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It
 was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had 
fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she 
complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her f
ather followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an u
lster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the hous
e thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascer
taining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put them
selves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a
 speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as 
to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police 
have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or som
e other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.' "

"And is that all?"

"Only 
one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."

"And it is--"

"That Miss Flora Milla
r, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse a
t the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole 
case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."

"And an exceedingly interesting cas
e it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock 
makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going
, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."

"Lord Robert St. Simon," an
nounced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pal
e, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant 
lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue 
impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as h
e swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was c
areful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leathe
r shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swing
ing in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.

"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and
 bowing. "Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and 
we will talk this matter over."

"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have be
en cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I pr
esume that they were hardly from the same class of society."

"No, I am descending."

"I beg pardon."

"My last clien
t of the sort was a king."

"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"

"The King of Scandinavia."

"What! Had he l
ost his wife?"

"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same
 secrecy which I promise to you in yours."

"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own c
ase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion."

"Thank you. I have already 
learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for ex
ample, as to the disappearance of the bride."

Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes
."

"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my
 facts most directly by questioning you."

"Pray do so."

"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"

"In San Franci
sco, a year ago."

"You were travelling in the States?"

"Yes."

"Did you become engaged then?"

"No."

"But you were
 on a friendly footing?"

"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused."

"Her father is very ri
ch?"

"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."

"And how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had 
nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."

"Now, what is your own 
impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"

The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared
 down into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During 
that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from 
Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and fre
e, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up he
r mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I h
ave the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I beli
eve that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."

"Have y
ou her photograph?"

"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman.
 It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black
 hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket
 and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.

"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"

"Y
es, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have
 now married her."

"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"

"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my f
amily."

"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?"

"I really have made no inquir
ies on the subject."

"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?"

"Yes."

"Was she i
n good spirits?"

"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives."

"Indeed! That is very i
nteresting. And on the morning of the wedding?"

"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."


"And did you observe any change in her then?"

"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever 
seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possibl
e bearing upon the case."

"Pray let us have it, for all that."

"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we w
ent towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment'
s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. 
Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed abs
urdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the genera
l public were present, then?"

"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."

"This gentleman 
was not one of your wife's friends?"

"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking 
person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."

"Lady 
St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do 
on re-entering her father's house?"

"I saw her in conversation with her maid."

"And who is her maid?"

"Alice is he
r name. She is an American and came from California with her."

"A confidential servant?"

"A little too much so. It 
seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these
 things in a different way."

"How long did she speak to this Alice?"

"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to th
ink of."

"You did not overhear what they said?"

"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was acc
ustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant."

"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And 
what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"

"She walked into the breakfast-room."

"On your arm?"


"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so
, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back."

"But this maid, Alice
, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, 
and went out."

"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman w
ho is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning."

"Ah, yes. I should 
like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her."

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and 
raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She us
ed to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but 
you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached
 to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reas
on why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She ca
me to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressi
ons towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had
 two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there wa
s no good in making a row."

"Did your wife hear all this?"

"No, thank goodness, she did not."

"And she was seen wa
lking with this very woman afterwards?"

"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious.
 It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."

"Well, it is a possible supposit
ion."

"You think so, too?"

"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"

"I do
 not think Flora would hurt a fly."

"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own t
heory as to what took place?"

"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the 
facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair
, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous distu
rbance in my wife."

"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has 
turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly exp
lain it in any other fashion."

"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And n
ow, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table 
so that you could see out of the window?"

"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."

"Quite so. Then I
 do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you."

"Should you be fortunate enough to so
lve this problem," said our client, rising.

"I have solved it."

"Eh? What was that?"

"I say that I have solved it.
"

"Where, then, is my wife?"

"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I a
m afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manne
r he departed.

"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said She
rlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I 
had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of 
several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to 
turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trou
t in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."

"But I have heard all that you have heard."

"Without, however, the know
ledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and s
omething on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but,
 hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are 
cigars in the box."

The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautic
al appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cig
ar which had been offered to him.

"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied.
"

"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the bus
iness."

"Really! You surprise me."

"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fing
ers. I have been at work upon it all day."

"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upo
n the arm of the pea-jacket.

"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."

"In heaven's name, what for?"

"In search 
of the body of Lady St. Simon."

Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

"Have you dragged th
e basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he asked.

"Why? What do you mean?"

"Because you have just as good a chance o
f finding this lady in the one as in the other."

Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know 
all about it," he snarled.

"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."

"Oh, indeed! Then you 
think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?"

"I think it very unlikely."

"Then perhaps you will kindly e
xplain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress
 of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "Th
ere," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master H
olmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"

"No.
 They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed t
o me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."

"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's bo
dy is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"

"At s
ome evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."

"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Are yo
u, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
 deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora 
Millar."

"And how?"

"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here i
s the very note." He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is re
ady. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, a
nd that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is t
he very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."

"
Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper i
n a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is inde
ed important," said he.

"Ha! you find it so?"

"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."

Lestrade rose in his triu
mph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"

"On the contrary, this is the
 right side."

"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here."

"And over here is what ap
pears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."

"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before,
" said Lestrade. " 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see not
hing in that."

"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at lea
st the initials are, so I congratulate you again."

"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in h
ard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to 
the bottom of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.

"Just
 one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matt
er. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person."

Lestrade looked sadly at my 
companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

He had 
hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says 
about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."

It was af
ter five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a con
fectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, a
nd presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humbl
e lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a g
roup of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the gen
ii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address
.

Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there w
as a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.

"They have laid the 
supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.

"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we 
may have some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy
 that I hear his step now upon the stairs."

It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, danglin
g his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

"My me
ssenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you
 good authority for what you say?"

"The best possible."

Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over h
is forehead.

"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such
 humiliation?"

"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation."

"Ah, you look on these th
ings from another standpoint."

"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acte
d otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one t
o advise her at such a crisis."

"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers up
on the table.

"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."

"I will make no 
allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Ye
s, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I h
ave brought an advocate here who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lo
rd St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have al
ready met."

At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes 
cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a 
quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his r
esolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.

"You're angry, Robert," said she. "We
ll, I guess you have every cause to be."

"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

"Oh, yes, I kn
ow that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, an
d from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fal
l down and do a faint right there before the altar."

"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leav
e the room while you explain this matter?"

"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had ju
st a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear th
e rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.

"Then I'll te
ll our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa 
was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and mad
e a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was F
rank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn'
t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would on
ly have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile
, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of t
ime and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said 
he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it ov
er, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and
 then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.

"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Monta
na, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspape
r story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the killed.
 I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctor
s in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then L
ord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I fel
t all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.


"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we c
an our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be
. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and 
looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, 
with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop.
 I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear.
 I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he s
eemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribb
le on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bou
quet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me 
to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now t
o him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.

"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in C
alifornia, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster
 ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those gre
at people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I
 saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I
 slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to 
me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed 
to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had t
aken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among
 the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, follow
ed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."

"I saw it in a paper," explaine
d the American. "It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we sh
ould do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish awa
y and never see any of them again--just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to 
me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Fran
k took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
 somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this 
good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he sh
owed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in
 the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we ca
me right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you
 pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me."

Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitud
e, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it 
is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? Yo
u won't shake hands before I go?"

"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly
 grasped that which she extended to him.

"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friend
ly supper."

"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in
 these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I
 will now wish you all a very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.

"Then I
 trust that you at least will honour me with your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an Amer
ican, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in 
far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag
 which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."

"The case has been an interesting one," 
remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may
 be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequenc
e of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade
 of Scotland Yard."

"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"

"From the first, two facts were very obvious to 
me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of 
it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to
 change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had bee
n in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because s
he had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influenc
e over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arr
ived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, a
nd why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood 
had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. S
imon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device 
for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significan
t allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a pri
or claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover
 or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."

"And how in the world did you find them?"

"
It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
 know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a 
week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."

"How did you deduce the select?"

"By the sel
ect prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotel
s. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue
, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before
, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His
 letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the lo
ving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in
 every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in 
particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."

"But with no very go
od result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."

"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps 
you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived i
n an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars tha
t we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only 
problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings."

XI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL 
CORONET


"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a madman coming
 along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."

My friend rose lazily from his a
rmchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, cris
p February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry 
sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either sid
e and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been clea
ned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the
 direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn 
my attention.

He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a co
mmanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and
 well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for 
he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any ta
x upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extr
aordinary contortions.

"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the 
houses."

"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is co
ming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the m
an, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.


A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and d
espair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his wor
ds out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason.
 Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him
 and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside
 him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

"You hav
e come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have 
recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me."

The 
man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over
 his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.

"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that yo
u have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.

"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,
 so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never y
et borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a
 form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer un
less some way be found out of this horrible affair."

"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a c
lear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you."

"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably fam
iliar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."

The n
ame was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in t
he City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitia
ble pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.

"I feel that time
 is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co
-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through 
this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and 
I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.

"It is, of course, well known to you that in
 a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as 
upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out mo
ney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during 
the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their 
pictures, libraries, or plate.

"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in t
o me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to y
ou I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,
 noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, b
ut he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

"
 'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'

" 'The firm does so whe
n the security is good.' I answered.

" 'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have $50,000 at o
nce. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matt
er of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to 
place one's self under obligations.'

" 'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

" 'Next Monday I h
ave a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think i
t right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.'

" 'I should be happy to ad
vance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more
 than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I mu
st insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'

" 'I should much prefer to have i
t so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard
 of the Beryl Coronet?'

" 'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,' said I.

" 'Precisely.' He op
ened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he ha
d named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lo
west estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with
 you as my security.'

"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustriou
s client.

" 'You doubt its value?' he asked.

" 'Not at all. I only doubt--'

" 'The propriety of my leaving it. You
 may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be
 able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'

" 'Ample.'

" 'You under
stand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I
 have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above
 all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal woul
d be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for ther
e are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however
, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'

"Seeing that my client was anxious to
 leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone onc
e more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivin
gs of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national posses
sion, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented 
to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turn
ed once more to my work.

"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in th
e office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would 
be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always car
ry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I ca
lled a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had t
aken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.

"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, fo
r I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set asid
e altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is qu
ite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came 
with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attract
ed admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we 
believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that 
it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to
 me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spo
iled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see th
e smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for b
oth of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.

"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me 
in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust h
im in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, h
aving charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned
 to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore m
e to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to bre
ak away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwe
ll, was enough to draw him back again.

"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell shoul
d gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could har
dly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had
 been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in
 cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I h
ave caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary
, who has a woman's quick insight into character.

"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but w
hen my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since
 as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as 
tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In 
only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devote
dly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have
 been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!


"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.

"When w
e were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the pr
ecious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in th
e coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much inter
ested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.

" 'Where have you put it?' as
ked Arthur.

" 'In my own bureau.'

" 'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he
.

" 'It is locked up,' I answered.

" 'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it
 myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'

"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of wha
t he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.

" 'Look here, dad,' said he with h
is eyes cast down, 'can you let me have $200?'

" 'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous w
ith you in money matters.'

" 'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money, or else I can never sh
ow my face inside the club again.'

" 'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.

" 'Yes, but you would not have me leave
 it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will 
not let me have it, then I must try other means.'

"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.
 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.

"When h
e was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round
 the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform my
self that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fa
stened as I approached.

" 'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the 
maid, leave to go out to-night?'

" 'Certainly not.'

" 'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that 
she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'

" 'You
 must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'

" 'Quite s
ure, dad.'

" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.

"I am endea
vouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will questio
n me upon any point which I do not make clear."

"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."

"I come to a
 part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in
 my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some
 sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window h
ad gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of f
ootsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner
 of my dressing-room door.

" 'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'

"The 
gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside th
e light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At
 my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold c
orners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.

" 'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You ha
ve destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'

" 'Stolen!' he cried.


" 'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

" 'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' sa
id he.

" 'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not
 see you trying to tear off another piece?'

" 'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any l
onger. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house 
in the morning and make my own way in the world.'

" 'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-ma
d with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.'

" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he
 with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the polic
e find what they can.'

"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the 
first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with
 a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into the
ir hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms 
folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private 
matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law sh
ould have its way in everything.

" 'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your 
advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.'

" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that yo
u may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implo
red him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he thre
atened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had 
done with the three missing stones.

" 'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, a
nd no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling 
us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'

" 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' h
e answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him.
 There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not onl
y of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; bu
t no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.
 This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to 
you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at pre
sent make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of $100
0. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a 
hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got be
yond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire
.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.

"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur
's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think."

"Do you go out much in society?"

"Art
hur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it."

"That is unusual in a young girl."

"She is of a q
uiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty."

"This matter, from what you say, seems to h
ave been a shock to her also."

"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."

"You have neither of you any doubt as 
to your son's guilt?"

"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."

"I hardly co
nsider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?"

"Yes, it was twisted."

"Do you no
t think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?"

"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him 
and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not 
say so?"

"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways.
 There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your s
leep?"

"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."

"A likely story! As if a man
 bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these
 gems?"

"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them."

"Have they th
ought of looking outside the house?"

"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been m
inutely examined."

"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes ve
ry much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case;
 to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down fr
om his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main 
force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such ski
ll that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself t
o the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

"But what other is there?" crie
d the banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"

"It is our tas
k to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and 
devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."

My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in thei
r expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which
 we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhap
py father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as lon
g as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern subu
rb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client ap
peared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke int
o a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairba
nk, the modest residence of the great financier.

Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing bac
k a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron g
ates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between tw
o neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a l
ane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoro
ughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the trades
men's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into th
e dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened an
d a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darke
r against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's fac
e. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impr
essed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her a
s she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, 
she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.

"You have given orders
 that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked.

"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the 
bottom."

"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm
 and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."

"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"Who knows? 
Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."

"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw 
him with the coronet in his hand?"

"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it t
hat he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"

"
I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful
 consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deepl
y into it."

"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He i
s round in the stable lane now."

"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? A
h! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cou
sin Arthur is innocent of this crime."

"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," re
turned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing Mis
s Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"

"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."


"You heard nothing yourself last night?"

"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I c
ame down."

"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?"

"Yes."

"Were they
 all fastened this morning?"

"Yes."

"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle 
last night that she had been out to see him?"

"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may
 have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."

"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,
 and that the two may have planned the robbery."

"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banke
r impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"

"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. W
e must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?"

"Yes; wh
en I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"D
o you know him?"

"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."

"H
e stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the d
oor?"

"Yes, he did."

"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"

Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expres
sive black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answe
ring smile in Holmes' thin, eager face.

"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish 
to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."

He
 walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable
 lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shal
l go upstairs," said he at last.

The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carp
et, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

"Which key was u
sed to open it?" he asked.

"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."

"Have yo
u it here?"

"That is it on the dressing-table."

Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

"It is a noisele
ss lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must hav
e a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specim
en of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet
 was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.

"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is 
the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."


The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying," said he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his stre
ngth upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the f
ingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happe
n if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened wit
hin a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"

"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."


"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?"

"I confess that I still share my uncle'
s perplexity."

"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"

"He had nothing on save only his trousers a
nd shirt."

"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be e
ntirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now c
ontinue my investigations outside."

He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmar
ks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with
 snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.

"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," 
said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my rooms."

"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"

"I cannot tel
l."

The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"

"My opin
ion is in no way altered."

"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night
?"

"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do w
hat I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get ba
ck the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw."

"I would give my fortune to have them back."

"Very
 good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over
 here again before evening."

It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although 
what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endea
voured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in de
spair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down ag
ain in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, an
d his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.

"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the gl
ass above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on t
he trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I m
ay be back in a few hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two round
s of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.

I had just finished my 
tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it d
own into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.

"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on.
"

"Where to?"

"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me i
n case I should be late."

"How are you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatha
m since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have miss
ed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return
 to my highly respectable self."

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his wo
rds alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened up
stairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his c
ongenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no unco
mmon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me
 no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was wi
th a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.

"You will excuse my beginn
ing without you, Watson," said he, "but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."


"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."

It w
as, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was nat
urally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whit
er. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and
 he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.

"I do not know what I have done to be so sever
ely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left 
to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."


"Deserted you?"

"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon th
e hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have
 been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:


" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible 
misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, an
d I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do no
t search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving



" 'MARY.'

"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"

"No, no, nothing of
 the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubl
es."

"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?"

"You w
ould not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?"

"I would pay ten."

"That would be unnecessary. Three thousa
nd will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make
 it out for $4000."

With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took o
ut a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

With a shriek of joy o
ur client clutched it up.

"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"

The reaction of joy was as passionate
 as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder
," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.

"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."

"No, the debt
 is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
 should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one."

"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"

"
I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."

"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once t
o let him know that the truth is known."

"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with 
him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right a
nd to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
 lips."

"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"

"I will do so, and I will show you 
the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to 
hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."


"My Mary? Impossible!"

"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the tr
ue character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in Englan
d--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of s
uch men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alo
ne had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of
 seeing him nearly every evening."

"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.

"I 
will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your r
oom, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pres
sed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled
 at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love o
f a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instr
uctions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the serv
ants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his 
interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night h
e heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealth
ily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on 
some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from t
he room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. 
She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, w
hence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to so
meone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid b
ehind the curtain.

"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the 
woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, a
nd how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, spr
ang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell 
tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the 
coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then som
ething suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, 
ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring t
o straighten it when you appeared upon the scene."

"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.

"You then roused his anger 
by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true
 state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the 
more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret."

"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw th
e coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for 
five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I hav
e misjudged him!"

"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observ
e if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and
 also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it a
ll trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had sto
od and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that
 they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel
 marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the ma
id and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden 
without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a
 very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.

"There was a double line of tracks of a booted 
man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced fro
m what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, a
nd as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the oth
er. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. T
hen I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, wh
ere the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to 
show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it 
was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, 
so there was an end to that clue.

"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framewo
rk of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outl
ine of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion 
as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been oversee
n by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united st
rength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragm
ent in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought hi
m the coronet?

"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however imp
robable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niec
e and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There coul
d be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her
 secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
 how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.

"And who could it be who was her
 confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I kne
w that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Bur
nwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those b
oots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himsel
f that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.

"Well, your own good sense
 will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an
 acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense
 of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
 saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."

"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. H
older.

"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate par
t which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute 
a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everyt
hing. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from
 the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little
 more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out th
e first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three
!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecutio
n. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told
 him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's wo
rk."

"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words
 to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I
 have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to w
hat you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"I thin
k that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too,
 that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment."

XII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE C
OPPER BEECHES


"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisemen
t sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest
 pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in 
these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to
 embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have 
figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those 
faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province."

"And yet," said I, smiling, 
"I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."

"Yo
u have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-w
ood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have er
red perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the ta
sk of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about t
he thing."

"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I wa
s repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character
.

"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If
 I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Lo
gic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what 
should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."

It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat
 after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the
 lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wr
eaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleare
d yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succ
ession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lect
ure me upon my literary shortcomings.

"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing
 at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of th
ese cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its leg
al sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Mis
s Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, w
ere all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bord
ered on the trivial."

"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold to have been novel and of inte
rest."

"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by h
is tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if yo
u are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost 
all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recoveri
ng lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at l
ast, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across
 to me.

It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:

"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anx
ious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess
. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,


"VIOLET HUNTER."

"Do yo
u know the young lady?" I asked.

"Not I."

"It is half-past ten now."

"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."


"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which ap
peared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also."

"Well, 
let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in questi
on."

As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a brigh
t, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in 
the world.

"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I have h
ad a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thoug
ht that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do."

"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be ha
ppy to do anything that I can to serve you."

I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and spee
ch of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping 
and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.

"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the fa
mily of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and 
took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered 
advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my w
it's end as to what I should do.

"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, an
d there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway
 was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little off
ice, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consul
ts her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown i
nto the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smil
ing face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of g
lasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair 
and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.

" 'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital
!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-l
ooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.

" 'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

" 'Yes
, sir.'

" 'As governess?'

" 'Yes, sir.'

" 'And what salary do you ask?'

" 'I had $4 a month in my last place with
 Colonel Spence Munro.'

" 'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air
 like a man who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and
 accomplishments?'

" 'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little Ger
man, music, and drawing--'

" 'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or
 have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted fo
r the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why
, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me
, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'

"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer
 seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, open
ed a pocket-book and took out a note.

" 'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until 
his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half t
heir salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'

"It seemed t
o me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advan
ce was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to k
now a little more before I quite committed myself.

" 'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.

" 'Hampshire. Charmin
g rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear y
oung lady, and the dearest old country-house.'

" 'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'


" 'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper
! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his h
ead again.

"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think 
that perhaps he was joking.

" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'

" 'No, no, n
ot the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would sug
gest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might wi
th propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'

" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'

" 'Quite so. In dress 
now, for example. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we
 might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?'

" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words
.

" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'

" 'Oh, no.'

" 'Or to cut your hair quite s
hort before you come to us?'

"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat lu
xuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing
 it in this offhand fashion.

" 'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly 
out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.

" 'I am afraid that it is quite essen
tial,' said he. 'It is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be con
sulted. And so you won't cut your hair?'

" 'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.

" 'Ah, very well; then
 that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In th
at case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.'

"The manageress had sat all this while bu
sy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face tha
t I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.

" 'Do you desire your name
 to be kept upon the books?' she asked.

" 'If you please, Miss Stoper.'

" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, s
ince you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ours
elves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I wa
s shown out by the page.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, 
and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, 
if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready t
o pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair 
to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined
 to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as 
to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman 
himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:


" 'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.

" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--M
iss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your
 decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We
 are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fa
ds may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and w
ould like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one
, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very
 well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconve
nience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our s
hort interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary ma
y recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and
 I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,


" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'


"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, 
however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."

"Well, M
iss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," said Holmes, smiling.

"But you would not advise me 
to refuse?"

"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for."

"What i
s the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"

"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opin
ion?"

"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured
 man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be 
taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"

"That is a possib
le solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice ho
usehold for a young lady."

"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"

"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good.
 That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? There m
ust be some strong reason behind."

"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards i
f I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."

"Oh, you may carry 
that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come 
my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself i
n doubt or in danger--"

"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"

Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be 
a danger if we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help
."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to H
ampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start
 for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her 
way.

"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who i
s very well able to take care of herself."

"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if w
e do not hear from her before many days are past."

It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled.
 A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange
 side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the l
ight duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthrop
ist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for hal
f an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when
 I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would alway
s wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.

The telegram which we event
ually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those 
all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a te
st-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow
 envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.

"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he,
 and turned back to his chemical studies.

The summons was a brief and urgent one.

"Please be at the Black Swan Hote
l at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.


"HUNTER."

"Will you come with me?" 
asked Holmes, glancing up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said
 I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."

"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had bet
ter postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning."

By eleven o'clock the ne
xt day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way
 down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ide
al spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun w
as shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All 
over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings
 peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.

"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the e
nthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.

But Holmes shook his head gravely.

"Do you know, Watson," s
aid he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference t
o my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, 
and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be co
mmitted there."

"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"

"They always f
ill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys 
in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."

"You horrif
y me!"

"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomp
lish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget 
sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word o
f complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses
, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the d
eeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser
. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is 
the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."

"No. If
 she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."

"Quite so. She has her freedom."

"What can be the matter,
 then? Can you suggest no explanation?"

"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the f
acts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we s
hall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss H
unter has to tell."

The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and ther
e we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.

"
I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know 
what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."

"Pray tell us what has happened to you."

"I wil
l do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into 
town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."

"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust
 his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.

"In the first place, I may say that I have 
met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But 
I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them."

"What can you not understand?"

"Their reasons f
or their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove
 me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself
, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. The
re are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroa
d, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the wo
ods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall doo
r has given its name to the place.

"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced
 by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us 
to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman,
 much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. Fr
om their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that 
his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that 
the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could no
t have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's yo
ung wife.

"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favou
rably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband 
and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and f
orestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to
 be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the
 saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the d
isposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a lit
tle creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to
 be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creatu
re weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the ca
pture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he
 has little to do with my story."

"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be re
levant or not."

"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which str
uck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for t
hat is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice sinc
e I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a v
ery tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleas
ant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in o
ne corner of the building.

"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third
, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.

" 'Oh, yes,' said he, turning
 to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I as
sure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue d
ress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it o
n we should both be extremely obliged.'

"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It 
was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not h
ave been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it
, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very larg
e room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair h
ad been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr.
 Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that 
I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle,
 however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad
, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the du
ties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.

"Two days later this same 
performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window
, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he
 told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow 
might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart
 of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

"You c
an easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could po
ssibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed
 with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a m
eans. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handke
rchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a l
ittle management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least 
that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southam
pton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important hig
hway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our fiel
d and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me
 with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand
 and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.

" 'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the r
oad there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'

" 'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.

" 'No, I know no one in the
se parts.'

" 'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'

" 'Surely it would be
 better to take no notice.'

" 'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away
 like that.'

"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, a
nd from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."


"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."

"You will find it rather disc
onnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the 
very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitch
en door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.


" 'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'

"I looked through 
and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.

" 'Don't be frightened,' sa
id my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really ol
d Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so t
hat he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his 
fangs upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it's as m
uch as your life is worth.'

"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom 
window about two o'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was s
ilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware 
that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was.
 It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It
 walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill 
to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.

"And now I have a very strange experience to tell
 you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. O
ne evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearrang
ing my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower
 one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed a
t not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I too
k out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. The
re was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.

"I took i
t up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thi
ng obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, 
turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that
 they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I re
turned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put mys
elf in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.

"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr.
 Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared
 not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suit
e, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through thi
s door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man 
to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his t
emples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.

"This aroused my curiosity, so
 when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the wi
ndows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth
 was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Ru
castle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.

" 'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed
 you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.'

"I assured him that I was not off
ended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutter
s up.'

"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.

" 'Photography is one of my ho
bbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Wh
o would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his 
eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that 
I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over
 them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some 
good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct whi
ch gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbid
den door.

"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and hi
s wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him thr
ough the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs 
there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both down
stairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, ope
ned the door, and slipped through.

"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turne
d at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which wer
e open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so t
hick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outsid
e of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and faste
ned at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door
 corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the 
room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gaz
ing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
 and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door.
 A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I tur
ned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the pa
ssage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.

" 'So,' said he, smili
ng, 'it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.'

" 'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.

"
 'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has
 frightened you, my dear young lady?'

"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on m
y guard against him.

" 'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie 
in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'

" 'Only that?' s
aid he, looking at me keenly.

" 'Why, what did you think?' I asked.

" 'Why do you think that I lock this door?'

" 
'I am sure that I do not know.'

" 'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?' He was still sm
iling in the most amiable manner.

" 'I am sure if I had known--'

" 'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put y
our foot over that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at
 me with the face of a demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'

"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I 
suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembl
ing all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened 
of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could 
only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as str
ong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the offic
e, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into
 my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a 
state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with 
the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my 
joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I mu
st be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so
 that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if yo
u could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do."

Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this e
xtraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of
 the most profound gravity upon his face.

"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.

"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucas
tle that she could do nothing with him."

"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"

"Yes."

"Is there a cel
lar with a good strong lock?"

"Yes, the wine-cellar."

"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a 
very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of 
you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman."

"I will try. What is it?"

"We shall be at the Copper Beeches
 by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. 
There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and t
hen turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely."

"I will do it."

"Excellent! We shall then look 
thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personat
e someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no 
doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You we
re chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very p
ossibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curiou
s chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and
 no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw yo
u, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his atten
tions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clea
r. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child."

"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ej
aculated.

"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the
 study of the parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insig
ht into the character of parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for
 cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bod
es evil for the poor girl who is in their power."

"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A t
housand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing
 help to this poor creature."

"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing
 until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery."

We we
re as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside
 public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting su
n, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.

"Have you mana
ged it?" asked Holmes.

A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," sa
id she. "Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's."


"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this
 black business."

We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in fron
t of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried
 the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes' face cloude
d over.

"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. No
w, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."

It was an old rickety door 
and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture s
ave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.


"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried
 his victim off."

"But how?"

"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto 
the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it."

"Bu
t it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away."

"He has come back an
d done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whos
e step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."

The 
words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a he
avy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes spra
ng forward and confronted him.

"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"

The fat man cast his eyes round, an
d then up at the open skylight.

"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have
 caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he coul
d go.

"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.

"I have my revolver," said I.

"Better close the front door," cri
ed Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a h
ound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man w
ith a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.

"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog
. It's not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"

Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle o
f the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's
 throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its 
keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, 
living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobere
d Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when t
he door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.

"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.

"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastl
e let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were 
planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted."

"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is c
lear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell
 what I know."

"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I
 am still in the dark."

"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha
' got out from the cellar. If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood 
your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.

"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time 
that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for h
er until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by 
will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr
. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would 
ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a
 paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her 
until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, 
and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as 
man could be."

"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly cl
ear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"

"Ye
s, sir."

"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler
."

"That was it, sir."

"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, an
d having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were th
e same as his."

"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.

"And in this
 way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when
 your master had gone out."

"You have it, sir, just as it happened."

"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,
" said Holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and
 Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that ou
r locus standi now is rather a questionable one."

And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the cop
per beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the c
are of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life t
hat he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southa
mpton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As
 to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when onc
e she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, whe
re I believe that she has met with considerable success.

PREFACE


As things now stand, the course of inst
ruction in American history in
our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.
Three separate b
ooks are used. First, there is the primary book, which
is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biograp
hies and
anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
grade, generally speaking, an expans
ion of the elementary book by the
addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high
school manual
. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving
fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it 
bluntly, we
do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
study of history in the lower gra
des. If mathematicians followed the
same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
multipli
cation table and fractions.

There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It
is that teachers
 have learned from bitter experience how little history
their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No 
teacher of
history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing
methods of historical instruction. If
 the study of history cannot be
made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and
languages, then th
e historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the succe
ssive
historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more
facts, more dates, more words--then history
 deserves most of the sharp
criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and
economics.

In this
 condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
new high school text in American history. Our first co
ntribution is one
of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the
biographies of heroes are left out. We
 frankly hold that, if pupils know
little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John
Smith by the t
ime they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the
same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than 
useless. It
is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
demonstrated to be progressive in character
.

In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our
reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a 
campaign or of a single
battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter
about which experts 
differ widely. In the field of military and naval
operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. T
o
dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
equally absurd to the serious student of milit
ary affairs. Any one who
compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign
with the account given
 by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further
comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would thi
nk
of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so use
ful in arousing the
interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that
deliberately appeals to boys an
d girls on the very threshold of life's
serious responsibilities.

It is not upon negative features, however, that we
 rest our case. It is
rather upon constructive features.

_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, histor
y. We have
tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of
each period, bringing in the narrativ
e rather by way of illustration.

_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to
explain how our 
nation has come to be what it is to-day.

_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
hi
story, especially in relation to the politics of each period.

_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wa
rs, the problems
of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.
These are the subjects whic
h belong to a history for civilians. These
are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must
unders
tand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.

_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have 
been able to
enlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention
to the history of those current q
uestions which must form the subject
matter of sound instruction in citizenship.

_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that
 America, with all her unique
characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we
have given diploma
cy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the
reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.

_Seventh._ W
e have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The
study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the mem
ory. We
have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,
reflection, and generalization--habits c
alculated to enlarge as well as
inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,
simple, and dire
ct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of the
m
will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.
The world will soon expect maturity from them
. Their achievements will
depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The
effectiveness of their ci
tizenship in our republic will be measured by
the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
infor
mation.

HISTO
RY OF THE UNITED STATES




PART I. THE COLONIAL PERIOD




CHAPTER I

THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA


The tide of m
igration that set in toward the shores of North America
during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one
 phase in
the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
earth. The ancient Greeks flung out th
eir colonies in every direction,
westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into
Asia Minor, per
haps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported
by their armies and their government, spread their dominion
 beyond the
narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to
the sands of Arabia. The Teutoni
c tribes, from their home beyond the
Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the
beginni
ngs of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires
the settlement of America was merely a part. And it wa
s, moreover, only
one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the
institutions, and the trade of E
urope to the very ends of the earth.

In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed
from that 
of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them
affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire f
rom the
altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to
America disliked the state and disowned
 the church of the mother
country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set
up altars of their 
own. They sought not only new soil to till but also
political and religious liberty for themselves and their children
.


THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION

It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of
wa
ter and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the
seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies 
called for huge outlays
of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
the life of the sett
lers until they could gather harvests of their own.
Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to 
risk
the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and
mariners for the exploration of inland wate
rs. Leaders of good judgment,
adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an
enterprise demanded cap
ital larger than the ordinary merchant or
gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
ass
ume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy
proprietors were able to establish colonies on 
their own account, it was
the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
beginning.

=The Trading C
ompany.=--English pioneers in exploration found an
instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, 
which
had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.
Such a corporation was composed of many 
persons of different ranks of
society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a
particular under
taking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal auth
ority; it
received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from
the king and carried on its operat
ions under his supervision and
control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the
corporation and 
gave them certain powers in the management of its
affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was 
in
fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the
corporation remained in England, as in the ca
se of the Virginia Company,
they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the
seas themselves 
and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,
they became the direct government of the country they posses
sed. The
stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the
chief magistrate.

[Illustration: JOHN
 WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY
COMPANY]

Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to
 the
trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,
in 1606, that laid during the following
 year the foundations of Virginia
at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,
chartered in 1
621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New
Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massac
husetts
were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated
in 1629 under the title: "The govern
or and company of the Massachusetts
Bay in New England." In this case the law did but incorporate a group
drawn toget
her by religious ties. "We must be knit together as one man,"
wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in Amer
ica. Far to the
south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company
in 1638 made the beginnings o
f a settlement, christened New Sweden; it
was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the
rul
e of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.

In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the "comp
any
colonies." It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,
James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor me
n, especially those imprisoned
for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George
II, in 1732, a r
oyal charter uniting several gentlemen, including
himself, into "one body politic and corporate," known as the "Trust
ees
for establishing the colony of Georgia in America." In the structure of
their organization and their methods of g
overnment, the trustees did not
differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
colonization. Thou
gh their purposes were benevolent, their transactions
had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of 
business.

=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in
the settlement of America was the 
religious brotherhood, or
congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
religious faith. B
y one of the strange fortunes of history, this
institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a

potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far
away from Galilee. "And the multitude of them
 that believed were of one
heart and of one soul," we are told in the Acts describing the Church at
Jerusalem. "We ar
e knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tie
d to all
care of each other's good and of the whole," wrote John Robinson, a
leader among the Pilgrims who founded th
eir tiny colony of Plymouth in
1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a
written and sign
ed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to
the common good, which served as a guide to self-government un
til
Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.

[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]

Three other colonies, all of
 which retained their identity until the eve
of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the
congregati
ons of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New
Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were fou
nded by
small bodies of men and women, "united in solemn covenants with the
Lord," who planted their settlements in t
he wilderness. Not until many a
year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers
to the Narrag
ansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of
incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the cong
regation
of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River
Valley did the king of England give 
Connecticut a charter of its own
(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the
towns laid 
out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts
were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in
 1679.

Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of
the royal lawyers did but confirm right
s and habits of self-government
and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The
towns of Hartfo
rd, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily
under their "Fundamental Orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639;
 so had
the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their "Fundamental
Articles" drafted in the same year. The p
ioneers on the Connecticut
shore had no difficulty in agreeing that "the Scriptures do hold forth a
perfect rule for 
the direction and government of all men."

=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the
prop
rietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word
"property," implies, the proprietor was a person to who
m the king
granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy
for his own benefit and profit, w
ith the right to hand the estate down
to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and
powerful pe
rson, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the
ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers nece
ssary to found
and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor
worked alone. Sometimes two or more
 were associated like partners in the
common undertaking.

Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the
 Carolinas,
owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor
in most cases their prosperity, 
to the proprietary system. Maryland,
established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and
blessed with 
religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under
the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the
 American
union. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley
and Carteret, in 1664, passed under
 the direct government of the crown
in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the
generous s
pirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader
of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in
 1681 and in
whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first
organized as one colony in 1663 under 
the government and patronage of
eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a
century both 
became royal provinces governed by the king.

[Illustration: WILLIAM PENN, PROPRIETOR OF PENNSYLVANIA]


THE COLONIAL
 PEOPLES

=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except
New York and Delaware, were English.
 During the early days of all, save
these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from
England. Th
e colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,
women, and children of "all sorts and conditions." The major
 portion
were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With
them were merchants and gentlemen who b
rought their stocks of goods or
their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and
Cambridge to preach th
e gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an
English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with

America. The people represented every religious faith--members of the
Established Church of England; Puritans who ha
d labored to reform that
church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;
and Catholics, who c
lung to the religion of their fathers.

New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and
1640
, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand
Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the col
onies of the far
North. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater
portion of the New England 
people sprang from this original stock.
Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
England al
one. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other
nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the Engl
ish in
numbers.

The populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while
 receiving a steady stream of
immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from
the older settlem
ents. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England
in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to l
ament that
"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church." North Carolina was
first settled toward the northern
 border by immigrants from Virginia.
Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the
way from N
ew England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how
little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.

=The
 Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were
the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English
 in tongue. Both
religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch
ancestors, in the days of Crom
well, had settled in the north of Ireland
whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There
the
 Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of
religion and growing prosperous in the manufactu
re of fine linen and
woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth
century their religious wors
hip was put under the ban and the export of
their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades
t
wenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all
during the eighteenth century the migration conti
nued to be heavy.
Although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish
and the Scotch who came dir
ectly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of
the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.

[Illustratio
n: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH
IMMIGRANTS]

These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jer
sey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon
the scene, they found much of the land imm
ediately upon the seaboard
already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people
settling the interio
r and upland regions. There they cleared the land,
laid out their small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the so
il,"
hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the
luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy li
fe of the leisurely
merchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen
manufactures, which, flourishing in t
he supple fingers of their tireless
women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in
the colonies
. Of their labors a poet has sung:

        "O, willing hands to toil;
    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song a
nd bound to the kindly soil;
    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field."

=The Germans.=--Third am
ong the colonists in order of numerical
importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in
coloni
al records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minui
t, the famous
governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and
Jacob Leisler, leader of a popula
r uprising against the provincial
administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The
wholesale migr
ation of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.
Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to culti
vate his
lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine
country. A great association, known as
 the Frankfort Company, bought
more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
center at Germantow
n for the distribution of German immigrants. In old
New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for
dis
tribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered
to the German farmers and in nearly every colon
y were to be found, in
time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that
German princes were frigh
tened at the loss of so many subjects and
England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
dominions
. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the
colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more tha
n two
hundred thousand.

The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South
Germany. Wars, religi
ous controversies, oppression, and poverty drove
them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were 
also
among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass
, paper, and woolen mills,
dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the
wealth and independe
nce of the province.

[Illustration: _From an old print_

A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]

Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the 
Germans did not speak the language of the
original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,
bui
lt their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published
their own books. Their clannish habits often irrita
ted their neighbors
and led to occasional agitations against "foreigners." However, no
serious collisions seem to hav
e occurred; and in the days of the
Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot
armies side by
 side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish
sections.

=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scot
ch-Irish, and the
Germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other
racial strains as well, varyi
ng in numerical importance but contributing
their share to colonial life.

From France came the Huguenots fleeing fro
m the decree of the king which
inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.

From "Old Ireland" came thousands of n
ative Irish, Celtic in race and
Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,
they revered ne
ither the government nor the church of England imposed
upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but ship
ping
records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left
the southern and eastern shores of Ireland
 for the New World.
Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native
stock. This surmise is well su
stained by the constant appearance of
Celtic names in the records of various colonies.

The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for rel
igious
and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete
liberty, but certainly more freedom than
 they enjoyed in England,
France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize
their right to live 
in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going
habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the sea
board
towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the
mayor and council of New York forbade them
 to sell by retail and on
another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,
Philadelphia, and Char
leston were more hospitable, and there large
Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,

flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.

Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly sub
merged
beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued
to hold their own for more than a hundr
ed years after the English
conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the
170,000 inhabitan
ts of the province were descendants of the original
Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life a
nd
manners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
tongue as they did to their capacious farmh
ouses or their Dutch ovens;
but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in
beside them to farm 
and trade.

The melting pot had begun its historic mission.


THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION

Considered from one side, 
colonization, whatever the motives of the
emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay
fo
r their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on
the way of production. Under this stern economic
 necessity, Puritans,
Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.

=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of 
the immigrants to America
in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,
and paid their own
 passage. What proportion of the colonists were able
to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conje
cture.
Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the
family fortunes of many early settler
s. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority
for the statement that "the settlers of New England were drawn from the
country gen
tlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother
country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old li
sts
show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and
good standing. They did not belong to the cl
asses from which emigration
is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left
behind." Though it
 would be interesting to know how accurate this
statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as

yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an
unsolved problem just how many of the colonists wer
e able to bear the
cost of their own transfer to the New World.

=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousa
nds of immigrants
were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
a doubt by the shipping re
cords that have come down to us. The great
barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost
of
 the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out
whereby shipowners and other persons of means furn
ished the passage
money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a
term of years to repay the 
sum advanced. This system was called
indentured servitude.

It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded 
the original
twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the
Huguenots combined. All the way do
wn the coast from Massachusetts to
Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
women, and c
hildren serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the prop
ortion of bond
servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other
promoters anxiously sought for wor
kers of every nationality to till
their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
moon. Hence
 the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.
Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form o
f cheap land,
and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing
servants. In Pennsylvania, it was
 not uncommon to find a master with
fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds
of all t
he immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the
eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were
 in bondage.
In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but
it formed a considerable part of
 the population.

The story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
things in the history of la
bor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the
feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.
The
y likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had
a time limit. Still they were subject to many s
pecial disabilities. It
was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far
heavier than were impose
d upon freemen for the same offense. A free
citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
let
 off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
was whipped at the post and fined as well.

The
 ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A
bondman could not marry without his master's cons
ent; nor engage in
trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or
indeed for any infraction of t
he law, the term of service was extended.
The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, "was
little
 better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put
them at the mercy of their masters." It would not be
 unfair to add that
such was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the
temper of their masters.


Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the
Old World a chance to reach the New--an oppo
rtunity to wrestle with fate
for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude
were over, if t
hey survived, they might obtain land of their own or
settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the ga
mble
proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise
out of the state of poverty and dependence
 into which his servitude
carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real
avenue to freedom 
and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America
have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.

=The Tran
sported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure
settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies 
in America
either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,
and children from the streets of 
English cities. In 1680 it was
officially estimated that "ten thousand persons were spirited away" to
America. Many o
f the victims of the practice were young children, for
the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and depende
nts were
sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.
In a single year, 1627, about fifte
en hundred children were shipped to
Virginia.

In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few
ro
mances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from
their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpe
nters, smiths, and
weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus
dragged off to the New World 
to be sold into servitude for a term of
five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
fortunes. 
In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
lived to make his way back to England and establish his
 claim to a
peerage.

Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts
deported to the colonies fo
r life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The
Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.

Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the "criminals" were
only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cr
uel laws. A peasant
caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl
who purloined a pocket han
dkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders
w
ere "political criminals"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed
the government. This class included now Irish w
ho revolted against
British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against
the Puritan revolutionists
; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the
monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who
joine
d in political uprisings against the king.

=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
in
dentured servants and whites carried to America against their will
were the African negroes brought to America and so
ld into slavery. When
this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was
looked upon as a tempor
ary necessity to be discarded with the increase
of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those plant
ers
who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a
system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow
 process did chattel slavery
take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
supply. In 1650,
 thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there
were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.

The great incre
ase in later years was due in no small measure to the
inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in O
ld and in
New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,
they crowded the Southern ports with t
heir vessels. The English Royal
African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
to ten thous
and slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far
behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary t
raffic.

As the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
rose, and as whole sections were over
run with slaves and slave traders,
the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail
the import
ation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was
futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From 
time to time
similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South
Carolina, in 1760, absolutely proh
ibited importation; but the measure
was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted
by a cent
ury of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:
"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coa
st of Africa
hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
present encouragement, we have to
o much reason to fear, will endanger
the very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply
impressed wit
h these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to
remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of
 this colony
which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerce."

All such prot
ests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps
and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounte
d to more than
half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,
and Georgia--the slaves nearly 
equalled or actually exceeded the whites
in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the
population
. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania
about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To th
e North, the
proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
on the same legal footing as in 
the South. In New York approximately one
in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few
freedme
n.

The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were
all unfavorable to the growth of a servil
e population. Still, slavery,
though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern
ships carried 
slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the
plantations to Europe. "If the Northern states will consult th
eir
interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will
increase the commodities of which they will beco
me the carriers," said
John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the
Constitution of the Unite
d States. "What enriches a part enriches the
whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,"

responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.

CHAPTER II

COLONIAL AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, AND COMMERCE

THE LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT


=The Significance 
of Land Tenure.=--The way in which land may be
acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
d
eep influence on the life and culture of a people. The feudal and
aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a 
system of landlordism
which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,
the land was nearly all h
eld in great estates, each owned by a single
proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the

law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his
landed property to his eldest son. This preven
ted the subdivision of
estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
owning their own land. 
It made a form of tenantry or servitude
inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also
enabled the
 landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their ec
onomic and
political control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was
equally important in the developmen
t of America, where practically all
the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
livelihood from
 the soil.

=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad
extent of land awaiting the white man'
s plow, it was impossible to
introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
and tenants that e
xisted across the sea. So it happened that almost
every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalis
m,
was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though
owned by the London Company, was tilled in 
common by the settlers. No
man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:
"Labor and share alike
." All were supposed to work in the fields and
receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims
attem
pted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and
distributing the joint produce of their labor with rou
gh equality among
the workers.

In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the
lazy men in 
Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: "Everyone 
that gathereth
not every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the
river and forever banished from th
e fort and live there or starve." Even
this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until
each man 
was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered
the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In 
Plymouth, where
the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar
to those in Virginia, and the
 system was given up for one of separate
fields in which every person could "set corn for his own particular."
Some o
ther New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of
their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into co
mmon ownership and
labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
the land. "By degrees it was
 seen that even the Lord's people could not
carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
pr
actice."

=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and
Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were
 the feudal elements of
land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions
of the South, and to s
ome extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact
a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charte
r. He
could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
large or small lots. While he generall
y kept for himself an estate of
baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any
considerable p
art of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either
sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals
 on
condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as
"quit rent." In Maryland, the proprietor som
etimes collected as high as
$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this
source. In Pennsylvania
, the quit rents brought a handsome annual
tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,
the
 king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the
land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of
 the Revolution. The quit
rent,--"really a feudal payment from freeholders,"--was thus a material
source of income fo
r the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever
it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of cons
tant
irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of
grievances which led to the American Revolution.


Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in
the numerous manors or the huge landed est
ates granted by the crown, the
companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there
were sixty manors
 of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and
tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restricti
ons of
tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of
which originated in the days of the Du
tch West India Company, when
extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
settlers. The V
an Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston
manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send
 a
representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New
York manors were in somewhat the same positio
n as serfs on old European
estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they
ground their grai
n at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial
power because he held court and meted out justice, in some insta
nces
extending to capital punishment.

The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence
as com
pared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge
estates, far wider in expanse than many a European bar
ony and tilled by
slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten
that this system of land tenu
re became the dominant feature of a large
section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
Ameri
ca.

[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]

=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however,
 and
throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of
servitude and tenantry and in the direction of 
the freehold; that is,
the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
family. This was favored by 
natural circumstances and the spirit of the
immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
labo
r made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the
crown to develop over the whole continent a network o
f vast estates. In
many sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,
the hills, and the narrow
 valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and
Ger
man peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not
propose to accept permanent dependency of any k
ind in the New. If they
could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced
proprietors and compa
nies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportion
s
became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the
farms were drawn from every quarter of wes
tern Europe; but the freehold
system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.

[Illustration
: _From an old print_

A NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]

=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of wes
tern
settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the
same pursuit--agriculture. They had a comm
on tie in that they both
cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
which arise from that 
occupation. Their methods and their culture,
however, differed widely.

The Southern planter, on his broad acres till
ed by slaves, resembled the
English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
labored with his
 own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice
and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who 
took his
entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,
silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in En
glish markets. Loving the
ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford
or Cambridge for t
heir education. In short, he depended very largely for
his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations 
with the
Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native
goods, for they were made on his own pla
ntation by his own artisans who
were usually gifted slaves.

The economic condition of the small farmer was totally d
ifferent. His
crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English
factors or the personal maintenance
 of a corps of artisans. He needed
local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,
weavers, wago
n-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
with the rough products of their native skill. The finer good
s, bought
by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not
buy. His wants were restricted to sta
ples like tea and sugar, and
between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community
was therefore more
 self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great
plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent
,
more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New
West.

=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and
 planter nevertheless were alike in
one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of
an expert 
for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as
a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the curre
nt of migration
set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over
mountains. Many of the later immig
rants, in their search for cheap
lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path
breakers to 
the West were native Americans of the second and third
generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the

mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following
their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, open
ing paths and sending back
stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular
settlers with lawful titl
es to the lands they had purchased, sometimes
singly and sometimes in companies.

In Massachusetts, the westward move
ment is recorded in the founding of
Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the
eighteent
h century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west
until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley 
settlements. In New
York, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,
and from that old Dutch cen
ter it radiated in every direction,
particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early
filled to i
ts borders, the beginnings of the present city of New
Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In
P
ennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of
advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the val
ley of the Schuylkill,
spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying
out Reading in 1748. Ano
ther current of migration was directed by the
Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
wh
ere Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties
a thin line of settlements stretched westward t
o Pittsburgh, reaching
the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn
family.

In the South t
he westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was
quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in 
the
cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from
the coast all the way from Maryland to Geo
rgia, was fed by two streams
of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
other colonies-
-Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing
the main supply. "By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to ove
rflowing
and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully
occupied. Even the mountain valleys ..
. were claimed by sturdy pioneers.
Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of
home-seekers had reac
hed the crest of the Alleghanies."

[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]

Beyond the mountains pioneers h
ad already ventured, harbingers of an
invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As
early as 17
69 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt
buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through t
he
Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in p
airs, and in groups, settlers
followed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the
Transylvania Company, e
mulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
rent
s from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution
there were several hundred people in the Kentucky reg
ion. Like the older
colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked
the Transylvania Company.
 They even carried their protests into the
Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
fourt
eenth colony."


INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming
, there was
a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the
staple industries of to-day, not omitt
ing iron and textiles, have their
beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
towns which
 enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seabo
ard
originated in the days when the king of England was "lord of these
dominions."

[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY:
 DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]

=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in
addition to sharing every
 hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor
of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry

which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in
abundance in the North and South. "Every farm h
ouse," says Coman, the
economic historian, "was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
serges, kerseys, and lin
sey-woolseys which served for the common wear."
By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured clo
th
in sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to
the West Indies. As the industry developed, 
mills were erected for the
more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and
spinning continued
 to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,
the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior "w
ere not
one whit behind their Yankee neighbors."

The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hard
ly be
overestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine
woolen cloth as the chief staple in a luc
rative foreign trade, and the
government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
protection. Wh
en the colonies were established, both merchants and
statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasin
g value;
but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of
the coarser varieties, were making it 
to sell. In the place of
customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon
English markets, here wa
s the germ of economic independence.

If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
trade, obs
ervant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth cent
ury the royal
governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home
government: "The consequence will b
e that if they can clothe themselves
once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of
England, the
y who already are not very fond of submitting to government
will soon think of putting in execution designs they have
 long harboured
in their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort
of people this country is in
habited by."

=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron
working--one of the earliest and mo
st picturesque of colonial
industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within
fifteen years aft
er the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began
at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,
C
onnecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in
1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years af
ter that. New Jersey had
iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
colony in 1665. Iron for
ges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and
the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then

laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
the great iron centers of the world. Virginia
 began iron working in the
year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon
lapsed, it was renew
ed and flourished in the eighteenth century.
Governor Spotswood was called the "Tubal Cain" of the Old Dominion
becau
se he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems
that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron found
ry. Nails, wire,
metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large
quantities; and Great Britain, b
y an act in 1750, encouraged the
colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.

=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the 
specialized industries in the colonies,
shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak
for 
timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope
made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in th
e seventeenth century a
ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century
shipyards were scattered a
long the New England coast at Newburyport,
Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.
Yards 
at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade
of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmingt
on and Philadelphia
soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal
the pace set by New Engla
nd. While Maryland, Virginia, and South
Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the
lucra
tive business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and
tar.

=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resou
rce of New England outside
of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy
sailors from Europe, lon
g before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished
under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with t
he
net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. "Look,"
exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commo
ns, "at the manner in
which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale
fishery. Whilst we follow the
m among the tumbling mountains of ice and
behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay
an
d Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic
circle, we hear that they have pierced into the o
pposite region of polar
cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
serpent of the south.... No
r is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst
s
ome of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gi
gantic game along
the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No
climate that is not witness to
 their toils. Neither the perseverance of
Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
of E
nglish enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by 
this recent
people."

The influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative
European trade was built up
on it. The better quality of the fish caught
for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or
excha
nged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The
lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies 
for slave
consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished
the raw materials for the thriving 
rum industry of New England. These
activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
demand for fi
shing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of 
the seaport
towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother
country for, out of the cash collected 
in the fish markets of Europe and
the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an
ever-widening c
ircle of American enterprise centered around this single
industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.


=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth
century, the commerce of the American coloni
es spread in every direction
until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,
and the profits 
gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern
historian has said: "The enterprising merchants of New England de
veloped
a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world." This
commerce, destined to be of such signi
ficance in the conflict with the
mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.

On the one side, it invol
ved the export of raw materials and
agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,
tobacco, rice,
 tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,
furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum,
 furs, shoes,
and small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact
astounding. A sarcastic writer, 
while sneering at the idea of an
American union, once remarked of colonial trade: "What sort of dish will
you make? N
ew England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,
flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add toba
cco. North
Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,
and Georgia will sprinkle the whole
 composition with sawdust. Such an
absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
discordant m
aterials as the thirteen British provinces."

On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,
consist
ing principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and
"India goods." Sugar and molasses, brought from the
 West Indies,
supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
and Connecticut. The carriage of 
slaves from Africa to the Southern
colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of
pounds of her 
capital.

The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part
controlled by English factors located in 
America, employed also a large
and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises
of Philadelphi
a; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the
Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterpri
se, they
were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for
world-wide commercial operations. Though 
fully aware of the advantages
they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British
navy, the Ameri
can merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to
contend with royal officers in order to shield American int
erests
against outside interference.

[Illustration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM
(NEW YORK CITY)]


Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce
seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is n
ot the test of its
significance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English
colonial trade in its ent
irety--a relation which can be shown by a few
startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to

the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American
Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to t
he American colonies
alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the
whole foreign business of En
gland two generations before. At the first
date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;
a
t the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,
Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to 
the value of $11,459; in
1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,
Pennsylvania imports i
ncreased fifty times within sixty-eight years,
amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the

colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were
indeed a great source of wealth to English merchan
ts.

=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made
overland transportation difficult and c
ostly, the many rivers and
harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the
colonies. The Connect
icut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in
the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible
 for
goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little
sailing vessels with comparative ease. 
Sloops laden with manufactures,
domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,
or Philadelph
ia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up
the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had
 for exchange
the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.
Larger ships carried the grain, li
ve stock, cloth, and hardware of New
England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,
leather, t
ar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut
shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Isl
and Sound to
Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.

=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving tra
de and industry
there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
which were soon reckoned amon
g the first commercial towns of the whole
British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
ports a
s Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are
mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood
 first in size among
these towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and western Jersey, it had
 drawn within its borders, just before the
Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with
some
what more than 20,000 people. New York, the "commercial capital of
Connecticut and old East Jersey," was slightly sma
ller than Boston, but
growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South
Carolina, with about 10
,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a
center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
o
f about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as "considerable
towns." In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, L
ancaster and York in
Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and
increasing trade, gave prophe
cy of an urban America away from the
seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,
Virginia, for 
example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a
dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. In
land county
seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,
and one wretched inn to house judg
es, lawyers, and litigants during the
sessions of the court.

The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial op
inion all out of
proportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one
thing; of the press and pol
itical activity, for another. Merchants and
artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising

from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,
gossip, religious controversy, and political 
discussion. In the market
places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and
laws, and so, mingl
ing with the townsmen, were drawn into the main
currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
inde
pendence.

Chapter III

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS


Colonial life, cr
owded as it was with hard and unremitting toil, left
scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. Ther
e was
little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
schools, libraries, and museums. Few the
re were with time to read long
and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
delight the ey
e and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the
intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, her
oic
efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane
of mere existence. After the first cleari
ngs were opened in the forests
those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the
thought and spi
rit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with
England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with
 history,
political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy
itself bore eloquent testimony to the 
high quality of the American
intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the
writings of distingui
shed Americans scattered from Massachusetts to
Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,
Hamilt
on, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,
and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusio
n that there was
something in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
power. Women surmounted even g
reater difficulties than the men in the
process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is
eviden
t in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her
husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. M
ercy Otis Warren,
the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British
propagandists; and the patriot news
papers founded and managed by women.


THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES

In the intellectual life of America, the churc
hes assumed a role of high
importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the
colonies--Maryland, Penns
ylvania, and New England--the religious impulse
had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In 
all
the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only
class with any leisure to devote to matters 
of the spirit. They preached
on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of
local problems 
and in the formation of political opinion, so much of
which was concerned with the relation between church and state.
 They
wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the
colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectua
l and spiritual, the
Americans received their formal education. In several of the provinces
the Anglican Church was e
stablished by law. In New England the Puritans
were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear the
ir
authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of
sects made the dominance of any single deno
mination impossible; and in
all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in
time a separation o
f church and state and freedom of opinion.

=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English
syst
em of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were
prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and
 favored by the
governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. "The
Established Church," says Lodge, 
"was one of the appendages of the
Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,
and the paris
h church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
planter who built and managed it." As in England, Catholics and

Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only
slowly and on sufferance were they admitted t
o the province; but when
once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,
by the Revolution, 
they outnumbered the adherents of the established
order.

The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxe
s in the
Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly
under the crown in 1754--this in spit
e of the fact that the majority of
the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics
it was like
wise established in Maryland. In New York, too,
notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church w
as
fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about
one-fifteenth of the population, exerted 
an influence all out of
proportion to their numbers.

Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church 
in the
colonies. It was supported by the British government and the official
class sent out to the provinces. Its bis
hops and archbishops in England
were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by
acts of Parli
ament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it
could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown
 and so
counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
America. The Church, always a strong 
bulwark of the state, therefore had
a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing
leaders 
firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influe
nce of the
Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to
calculate in advance the effect of 
their methods upon dissenting
Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
in the mother c
ountry.

=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial
unity, the same could not be said o
f Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims
had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a
separate and
 independent congregation before they came to America. The
Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within t
he Church,
soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke
of union with the Anglicans. In e
ach town a separate congregation was
organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
other off
icers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where
secular matters were determined. The union of church 
and government was
thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
enforced by civil authoritie
s; but this worked for local autonomy
instead of imperial unity.

The clergy became a powerful class, dominant throug
h their learning and
their fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for
the people to read--the f
amous Cotton Mather having three hundred and
eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the

civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan
Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on S
aturday evening and
lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and
all worldly conversation
 were absolutely prohibited during those hours.
A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in chur
ch
was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout
Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, v
entured forth on horseback
one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
him through a rif
t in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court
and fined for "his ungodly conduct." With persons accused of 
witchcraft
the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept
over Massachusetts in 1692, eight
een people were hanged, one was pressed
to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.

Just about this 
time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of
Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked 
upon it
with disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of
the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new d
ocument issued seven years later
wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
governor and re
served the power of appointment to the king. It also
abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, subs
tituting
for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an
official family, certain to be Episcopa
lian in faith and monarchist in
sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious
denomination
s, if they had the required amount of property, were
permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of 
the
crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that
province was brought into line with Connec
ticut, Rhode Island, and New
Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the
suffrage.

=Growth 
of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of
Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in tol
eration for
other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode
Island. There, under the leadership of 
Roger Williams, liberty in
matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by
granting in 1649 free
dom to those who professed to believe in Jesus
Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to

the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those "who
confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eter
nal God to be the
creator, upholder, and ruler of the World." By one circumstance or
another, the Middle colonies wer
e thus early characterized by diversity
rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,
Quakers, Bap
tists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,
Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intren
ched and
too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had
desired to do so. There were communities a
nd indeed whole sections where
one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature
steadily controlle
d by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,
and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.

The gov
ernment and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
economic and political tendencies to draw America aw
ay from the English
state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy
of bishops and archbishops
 to bind them to the seat of power in London.
Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
a
rticles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical
helped to train them for local self-government in m
atters political. The
spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,
nourished as it was ami
d favorable circumstances in the New World, made
them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
auth
ority imposed from without.


SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Pro
testant
denomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this
work the Bible became the center of inte
rest. The English version was
indeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
whose life had o
nce been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in
the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct,
 but also a
book of romance, travel, and history. "Legend and annal," says John
Richard Green, "war-song and psalm, s
tate-roll and biography, the mighty
voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission
journeys, of 
perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,
apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds 
unoccupied for
the most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the
English version of the Bible 
remains the noblest example of the English
tongue." It was the King James version just from the press that the
Pilgri
ms brought across the sea with them.

For the authority of the Established Church was substituted the
authority of th
e Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon
their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after the
ir arrival in
America, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
in seeing that their children 
and wards were taught to read religious
works and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was
scarcely
 twenty years old before education of this character was
declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public
 schools
where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
writing.

Outside of New England the idea of compulso
ry education was not regarded
with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
little schools kep
t by "dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons."
Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washingto
n in
the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes
girls, were taught to read and write. Where t
here were no schools,
fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
of learning. Though il
literacy was widespread, there is evidence to show
that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady

progress all through the eighteenth century.

=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the
es
tablishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in
1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended p
rimarily to train
"learned and godly ministers" for the Puritan churches of New England.
To the far North, Dartmouth,
 chartered in 1769, was designed first as a
mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England

farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New
Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Prin
ceton eleven years later,
was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the
Established Church as their 
source of inspiration and support: William
and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia
Un
iversity, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the
New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of rel
igious dissent and the
"republican tendencies" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away
from sectarianism. Brow
n, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the
Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,
o
rganized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by
giving representation on the board of trustees t
o several religious
sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men
to serve in public office
 as leaders of the people and ornaments to
their country.

=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these inst
itutions of
learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.
Many well-to-do families sent the
ir sons to Oxford or Cambridge in
England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families
there were
 intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
of adversity and who trained themselves until, in ever
y contest of mind
and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or
any other college. Such, fo
r example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose
charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a
fine r
ecord of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was
limited to a few years at a local school in Boston;
 but his
self-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal
for reading, and devoured, he tells
 us, his father's dry library on
theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's
_On the Huma
n Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with
secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his 
time,
Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he f
ound time to read widely
in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of
European savants for
 his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts
he "attained an acquaintance" with Latin, Italian, French, and Sp
anish,
thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
for all America at the court of the king
 of France.

Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found
all over colonial America. From th
is fruitful source of native ability,
self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of
the Revo
lution.


THE COLONIAL PRESS

=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a
government by 
public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of
political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free pr
ess. That
too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was
brought to Massachusetts in 1639, bu
t it was put in charge of an
official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty
years elapsed b
efore the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious
title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it
 had not
been running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed
it for discussing a political quest
ion.

Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704
there came a second venture in journalism, 
_The Boston News-Letter_,
which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
criticizing the auth
orities. Still the public interest languished. When
Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Couran
t_
about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one
newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he 
continued it; and his
confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette
or chronicle appeared w
ithin the next thirty years or more. Benjamin
Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five
newspa
pers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English
and one in German.

=Censorship and Restraints on 
the Press.=--The idea of printing,
unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,
however, slow in
 taking form. The founders of the American colonies had
never known what it was to have the free and open publication
 of books,
pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was
first discovered, the control of publi
shing was vested in clerical
authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in
the reign of Eliz
abeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal
prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and 
London;
and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the
official censor. When the Puritans were in
 power, the popular party,
with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence
royalist and cler
ical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the
restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more plac
ed
in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by
failing to renew the licensing act, did away ent
irely with the official

censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so
active and printing press
es were so numerous that official review of all
published matter became a sheer impossibility.

In America, likewise,
 some troublesome questions arose in connection
with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less

anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from
the prying eyes of the people all literature 
"not mete for them to
read"; and so they established a system of official licensing for
presses, which lasted until 1
755. In the other colonies where there was
more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
imp
unity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
printing anything displeasing to the colonial governmen
ts. In 1721 the
editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the
proprietary council and ordered to apol
ogize for a political article,
and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.
A still more f
amous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,
who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administratio
n. Lawyers who
ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
practice, and it became neces
sary to bring an attorney all the way from
Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the
approb
ation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of libe
rty itself, not
that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it
finally came, was the signal 
for an outburst of popular rejoicing.
Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing
is the f
reedom of the press.

Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the
vigilance of parents, a very 
large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of
the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
almanacs 
that streamed from the types, the people could follow the
course of public events and grasp the significance of polit
ical
arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an
independent opinion nourished by the press and e
nriched by discussions
around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to
British rule came, gover
nment by opinion was at hand. For every person
who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were
 a
thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had
spelled out their letters while poring over 
Franklin's _Poor Richard's
Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.


THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL
 INSTITUTIONS

Two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.
The one, exalting royal rights a
nd aristocratic privileges, was the
drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
England. T
he other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was
the growth in the power of the popular legislative assemb
ly. Each
movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the
passing years, until at last the final 
collision between the two ideals
of government came in the war of independence.

=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirt
een English colonies eight were
royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia
passed under 
the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of
the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corp
oration lost
its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later
stripped the colonists of the righ
t to choose their chief executive. In
the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were
given the p
rovincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,
severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendere
d by the
trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,
transferred to the Duke of York on its capture
 from the Dutch in 1664,
became a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New
Jersey, after remaining fo
r nearly forty years under proprietors, was
brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
Dela
ware, although they retained their proprietary character until the
Revolution, were in some respects like the royal c
olonies, for their
governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
of King George. Only two co
lonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,
retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone
had gove
rnors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.

The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who
 enjoyed
high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
turn. He enforced the laws and, usua
lly with the consent of a council,
appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and
reprieves; he wa
s head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief
of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced mart
ial law in
time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except
Massachusetts, he named the councilors 
who composed the upper house of
the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.
He summoned, a
djourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower
house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by th
e crown; and
he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America
all the elements of royal prerog
ative against which Hampden had
protested and Cromwell had battled in England.

[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S P
ALACE AT NEW BERNE]

The colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
office-seekers and hunters for lan
d grants. Some of them were noblemen
of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The
pretens
ions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges
granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did
 much to deepen
popular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to
adherents of the Established Church d
ispleased Dissenters. The
reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which
they had fled, stirre
d anew the ancient wrath against that combination.

=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward
admini
stration through royal governors was the second and opposite
tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of sel
f-government.
The voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
law-making through representati
ves in Parliament, and the idea was early
introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
its f
irst representative assembly appeared. As the towns of
Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the 
members of
the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was
adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Con
necticut formed a representative
system under their "Fundamental Orders" of 1639, and the entire colony
was given a r
oyal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical
considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and
 William
Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
considerable settlements were made.
 Thus by one process or another every
one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.

It is true that in the provisi
on for popular elections, the suffrage was
finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
toward 
the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to
be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, 
if there was no
house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.
In Massachusetts, the voter f
or member of the assembly under the charter
of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year

at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In
Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to fre
eholders owning fifty acres
or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons
worth at least fi
fty pounds in lawful money.

Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
considerable numbe
r of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of
the towns, who were by no means content with their position.
Nev
ertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fac
t a large proportion
of the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the
limited suffrage, acquir
ed a democratic tone.

The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
in battles with the r
oyal and proprietary governors. When called upon by
the executive to make provision for the support of the administra
tion,
the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
interest of the taxpayers. It made annua
l, not permanent, grants of
money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
treasurer to dole it out
. Thus the colonists learned some of the
mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious
official
s. The legislature also used its power over money grants to
force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise
 have vetoed.

=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many
and bitter were the contests 
between the royal and proprietary governors
and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how
the
 Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to
sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his
 salary. Then, with sly
humor, Franklin adds: "Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our
proprietary constitution 
for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own

before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value
of money and of course another spur to industr
y. Every land is not so
blessed."

It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily
as Franklin
's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like
Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encr
oached upon
executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If
we may believe contemporary laments
, the power of the crown in America
was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the
friends of t
he governor complained in 1747 that "the inhabitants of
plantations are generally educated in republican principles; 
upon
republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of
royal authority remains in the Northern col
onies." "Here," echoed the
governor of South Carolina, the following year, "levelling principles
prevail; the frame o
f the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if
he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got t
heir
whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the
assembly is by ballot; not civil posts o
nly, but all ecclesiastical
preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people."

Though baffled by the "leve
lling principles" of the colonial assemblies,
the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolve
d
a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the
obstinate provincials to terms. That system, trace
able in their letters
to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal
officers in the colonies w
ere to be made independent of the legislatures
by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army wa
s
to be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to
be revoked and government by direct royal 
authority was to be enlarged.

Such a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many
ministers of the 
crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army
independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to 
carry
out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both
practical and logical. Nor was it foun
ded on theory, for it came fresh
from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It
failed to take
 account of the fact that the American people were growing
strong in the practice of self-government and could dispen
se with the
tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or
how benevolent its intentions.

CHAPTER IV

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM


It is one of 
the well-known facts of history that a people loosely
united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, eve
n a
people torn by domestic strife, may be welded into a solid and compact
body by an attack from a foreign power. Th
e imperative call to common
defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common
service--these t
hings, induced by the necessity of resisting outside
interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, e
xcept,
perhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most
virulent of quarrels, temporarily at l
east. "Politics," runs an old
saying, "stops at the water's edge."

This ancient political principle, so well underst
ood in diplomatic
circles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American
colonies as to the countries of E
urope. The necessity for common
defense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it
has long been
 the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
in "a wilderness," this was not actually the case. From th
e earliest
days of Jamestown on through the years, the American people were
confronted by dangers from without. All a
bout their tiny settlements
were Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
as sharp conflic
ts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and
west was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the dis
aster to
the Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the British
empire. To the north and west were the Fre
nch, ambitious, energetic,
imperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the
advance of British domin
ion in America.


RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH

=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general state
ments about the
relations of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in
different shape in different 
sections of America. It was not handled
according to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,
which al
one could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither
did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded o
ne another, in an
irregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience
necessary for dealing wisely 
with Indian matters. As the difficulties
arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
were 
making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened
was the result of chance rather than of calculation
. A personal quarrel
between traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the
exchange of guns for fur
s, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper
often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character
.

On one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of
Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims th
e ways of the wilds; of
Roger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William
Penn treating with t
hem on his arrival in America. On the other side of
the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as t
he
frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the
Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell up
on the tiny settlements
with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A
generation later, Ki
ng Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the
Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought

the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own
destruction. In New York, the relations with the I
ndians, especially
with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and
desperate wars. Virginia and her 
Southern neighbors suffered as did New
England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the
Jamestown
 settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he
attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier w
as ablaze.
Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
an adequate defense and, failing 
in that plea, himself headed a revolt
and a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia
outposts advan
ced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives
was transferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to
 the
southeast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the
combined forces of the two Carolinas and Vi
rginia.

VIRGINIANS DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INDIANS]

From such horrors
 New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their
geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a
 policy of
conciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
full conflict with the allied Frenc
h and Indians. Georgia, by clever
negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms
with her belli
gerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor
generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier 
advanced,
especially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their
imperial enterprises. It was then that d
esultory fighting became general
warfare.

[Illustration: ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,
1750]


=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French
exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrenc
e country, the English
colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought
to their distant neighb
ors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in
1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in
st
rength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was
the statesmen in France and England, rather th
an the colonists in
America, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
empires in North America. It
 was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,
rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that
soun
ded the first note of colonial alarm.

Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
English and
 the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697),
 Queen Anne's
War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins
and their endings mainly to the i
ntrigues and rivalries of European
powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles
with the Fre
nch and their savage allies.

=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly
closed, however, b
efore the English colonists themselves began to be
seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in t
he
West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,
who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to
 the Gulf, had been followed
by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus
taking possessio
n of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.
Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 t
hey
occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion
over all the territory drained by the Ohio R
iver. Having asserted this
lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
1752-1754 Fort Le B
oeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper
waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the
stre
ams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,
in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep 
out of territory "so
notoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain," the
French showed no signs of r
elinquishing their pretensions.

[Illustration: _From an old print_

BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]

=The Final Phase--the Frenc
h and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the
shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French

and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the
conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia 
and finally involved
England and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and
minor powers on the other.
 On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in
1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the
d
ramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized
Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on th
e banks of the
Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were
triumphant. Well could the historian wr
ite: "Conquests equaling in
rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had
been achieved in
 the East." Well could the merchants of London declare
that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial ge
nius of
this world-wide conflict, commerce had been "united with and made to
flourish by war."

From the point of vie
w of the British empire, the results of the war
were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east o
f
the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The
remainder of the Louisiana territory was tr
ansferred to Spain and French
imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In
exchange for Havana,
 which the British had seized during the war, Spain
ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant d
id
Macaulay write in after years that Pitt "was the first Englishman of his
time; and he had made England the first c
ountry in the world."


THE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES

The various wars with the French and the Indians, tri
vial in detail as
they seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
destiny of America. Circumst
ances beyond the control of popular
assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation
among them,
 grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The
American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or a
t their
trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the
arts of warfare, and to practice, if in 
a small theater, the science of
statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so
tenaciously provinc
ial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.

=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to d
eal with
the problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the
Americans took the first steps toward union.
 Though there were many
common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly
fear of the Indians to pr
oduce in 1643 the New England Confederation,
composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The
col
onies so united were bound together in "a firm and perpetual league
of friendship and amity for offense and defense, 
mutual service and
succor, upon all just occasions." They made provision for distributing
the burdens of wars among t
he members and provided for a congress of
commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For
some 
twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold
meetings until after the extinction of the Indian 
peril on the immediate
border.

Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of
intercolonial co
operation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the
Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New Y
ork and the
colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany
with the agents of New York and Ma
ssachusetts to discuss problems of
mutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally
with the Car
olinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.

=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general coloni
al union was
made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a
conference was held at Albany to con
sider Indian relations, to devise
measures of defense against the French, and to enter into "articles of
union and co
nfederation for the general defense of his Majesty's
subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace
 as of
war." New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland were repre
sented. After a long discussion, a
plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was
adopted and sen
t to the colonies and the crown for approval. The
colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the

scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that
it had "too much weight in the democratic par
t of the constitution."
Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study
because it forecast man
y of the perplexing problems that were not solved
until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of whic
h
also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United
States.

=The 
Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed
the provincials the meaning of union likewise instru
cted them in the art
of defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last
French and Indian confli
ct, which stretched all the way from Maine to
the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer
,
it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and
the conduct of the militiamen was far from 
professional; but thousands
of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the
field. Men like Georg
e Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that
were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militia
men
could do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars
operating on American soil. "This whole 
transaction," shrewdly remarked
Franklin of Braddock's campaign, "gave us Americans the first suspicion
that our exal
ted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not
been well founded." It was no mere accident that the Virgi
nia colonel
who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the
army of the Revolution was the brav
e officer who had "spurned the
whistle of bullets" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.

=Financial Burde
ns and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were
learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills.
 All the
conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left
New England weak and almost bankrupt. 
The French and Indian struggle was
especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by
the colonie
s were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper
currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Co
mmerce
was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the
end came, both England and America were 
staggering under heavy
liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
accompanied by a commercial 
depression which extended over a period of
ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
ha
d to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel
which led to American independence.

=The Expul
sion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the
defeat administered to France, as time proved, were dif
ficult to
estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
that the colonists, already restive un
der their administration, had no
foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.
American lea
ders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis
were driven from the continent, thought that they had no
 other country
to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,
though defeated, was not out of t
he sphere of American influence; for,
as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by
Franklin t
hat assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the
Revolution.


COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNME
NT

It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought
forth American nationality. That was the 
product of the long strife
with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
independence. The forces 
that created this nation did not operate in the
colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course o
f
events in English domestic politics, and English measures of control
over the colonies--executive, legislative, and
 judicial--must all be
taken into account.

=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)
and
 the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime
(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at 
home that they had
little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
affairs. The restoration o
f the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by
internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
House
 of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II
(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regu
lating trade
by act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
powerful agencies to supervise the col
onies were created. At the same
time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
the annulment 
of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so
much self-government on the Puritans.

Charles' successor, Jam
es II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy t
hus
inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he
would have bent the Americans under a hars
h rule or brought on in his
dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.
He determined to 
unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more
efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces
. He
made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New
York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massac
husetts, annulled in the last
days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of
Connecticut would have
 been seized if it had not been spirited away and
hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.

For several month
s, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of
ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not
accu
stomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his
opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal
 service upon the
Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to
a preacher who denounced t
axation without representation. In the middle
of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came
th
at King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people
of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, sum
moned the countryside to
dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated
governor was arrested, impr
isoned, and sent back across the sea under
guard.

The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and M
ary
and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the
colonies. The new order was greeted with t
hanksgiving. Massachusetts was
given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,
restored the spirit i
f not the entire letter of self-government. In the
other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of

affairs was resumed.

=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of
Queen Anne, the successor
 of King William, the throne passed to a
Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,
was 
more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,
whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760,
 never even learned to
speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of
taking thought about 
colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had n
o
ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.
Moreover, during a large part of this peri
od, the direction of affairs
was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed
his somewhat cyni
cal view of politics by adopting as his motto: "Let
sleeping dogs lie." He revealed his appreciation of popular senti
ment
by exclaiming: "I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
expense of blood." Such kings and such minist
ers were not likely to
arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
sea.

=Control of the Cro
wn over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from
James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matter
s
personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal
officers acting under the authority of the cr
own. Systematic supervision
began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the
king's council to
 meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider
petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantation
s. In 1696
a regular board was established, known as the "Lords of Trade and
Plantations," which continued, until the
 American Revolution, to
scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were
to examine acts of 
colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those
assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions fr
om the
colonies relative to their affairs.

The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by
Americ
an legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.
If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended t
o the king the
exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person
who believed his personal or p
roperty rights injured by a colonial law
could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it
was t
he practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislat
ion was not,
therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the
suggestion of a highly efficient agency o
f the crown. All this was in
addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
provinces.

=Judicial Con
trol.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the
colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts 
of law. The
king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high
appellate powers over all judicial 
tribunals in the empire. The right
of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,
on the eve
 of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in
England or America, who, in the regular legal course, 
was aggrieved by
any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,
had the right, subject to cer
tain regulations, to carry his case to the
king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In
the
 exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court
could, and frequently did, declare acts of coloni
al legislatures duly
enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were
contrary to English law.

=Imp
erial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year
after year, the machinery for political and judici
al control over
colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in
the colonies were ordered not
 to approve any colonial law imposing a
duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North
Carolin
a laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as
"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufac
tures
throughout the continent." At other times, Indian trade was regulated in
the interests of the whole empire or g
rants of lands by a colonial
legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
North Carolina 
lest there should be retaliation.

In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
higher than 
that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the
Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the powe
r to
regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.
A superior judicial power, towering abov
e that of the colonies, as the
Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the
colonial legislature
s within the metes and bounds of established law. In
the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, 
and the
rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of
British imperial control over the American 
colonies.

So great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies
had to keep skilled agents in London
 to protect their interests. As
common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
arose, there app
eared in each colony a considerable body of men, with
the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed
 on their
enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
common mass nourishing the spirit o
f colonial nationalism. When to the
repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
Parliament
 applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.

=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As so
on as Parliament
gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the
American colonies under its 
sway as well. Between the execution of
Charles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense
body o
f legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of
America. All of it, based on the "mercantile" theor
y then prevalent in
all countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas
plantations in such a way as to fos
ter the commercial and business
interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had
got the upper
 hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the
British empire should be confined to agriculture and the product
ion of
raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.

_The Navigation Acts._--In the first ra
nk among these measures of
British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
the purpose of build
ing up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so
essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, 
and
French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and
it was worked out into a system early in t
he reign of Charles II
(1660-85).

The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
British sh
ips. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and
her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British
 subjects. No
European goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the
country that produced them or in En
glish ships. These laws, which were
almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the
colonists,
 compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse
effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulat
ed
shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave
the master builders of America an advantag
e over those of the mother
country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
policy written into t
he Navigation Acts.

_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was
deliberately aimed to prevent col
onial industries from competing too
sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may
be counte
d the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen
goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade betw
een towns and
colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New
England and New York were maki
ng thousands of hats a year and sending
large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,
and Po
rtugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that "no hats or felts,
dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be 
"put upon any vessel
or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
whatever." The effect of this
 measure upon the hat industry was almost
ruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
industry. B
y an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were
given free entry to England to encourage the production of 
the raw
material; but at the same time the law provided that "no mill or other
engine for slitting or rolling of iron
, no plating forge to work with a
tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel" should be built in the
colonies. As f
or those already built, they were declared public
nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interes
ts of
the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the
ban.

_The Trade Laws._--The third gro
up of restrictive measures passed by the
British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of
1663 r
equired the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain
or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and
 ginger consigned to
the continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom
duties and through a Br
itish merchant's hands paying the usual
commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the "enumerated
articles" wh
ich seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest
coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of 
time,
however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated
articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval
 stores, copper, furs,
hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies
were compelled to bring t
heir European purchases back through English
ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
agai
n.

_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of
English merchants and manufacturers, Parlia
ment sought to protect the
British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch
neighbors. New England
 merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where s
ugar
and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting
on the protests of English planters in 
the Barbadoes and Jamaica,
Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on
sugar and molasses 
imported into the colonies from foreign
countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the
Frenc
h and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were
not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with 
the foreigners went on
merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.

=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As c
ompared with the strict monopoly
of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the
policy of Eng
land was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the
restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to 
be
favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,
redounded to the advantage of American shipbui
lders and the producers
of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British
ports were granted to col
onial producers as against foreign competitors
and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage
colon
ial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in
the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the
 effect that the
colonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial
legislation. Certainly after th
e establishment of independence, when
free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves
handicapped by
 being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
and the recipients of bounties in English markets.

Be that 
as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
against the mother country on account of the trade an
d navigation laws
enacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively
few were engaged in the hat 
and iron industries as compared with those
in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America
t
o agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of
the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely
 in the hands of women
and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was
not the sole support o
f any considerable number of people.

As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those
relating 
to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were
boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as
 a bow to the
English government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and
molasses from the French and Dutch
 colonies were shipped into New
England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against
smuggling and
 sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed
in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of
 "the galling
restraints of trade" until after the French war, when the British
government suddenly entered upon a ne
w course.


SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD

In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,

in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of
a century and a half--a new nation was being
 prepared on this continent
to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of
migration. Western Eu
rope contributed emigrants of many races and
nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical
import
ance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot
were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, a
nd Irish. Thousands
of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as
domestic servants in the 
North.

Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims
and Puritans of New England, the Frenc
h Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and
Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments
that denied them
 the right to worship God according to the dictates of
their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of pov
erty in
the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the
negroes from Africa, were dragged here a
gainst their will. The lure of
adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
enterprising merchan
ts.

How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
and borrowed or furnished the funds nece
ssary to pay the way. In other
cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it
was the wealt
hy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who
undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to 
pay their
own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years
in exchange for the cost of the pas
sage. Negroes were brought on account
of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.

Whatever the motive for thei
r coming, however, they managed to get
across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down
forests,
 built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,
schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. T
hey spun and
wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and
traded. Here and there on favorable ha
rbors they established centers of
commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
Charleston. As
 soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial peri
od, they
were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.

Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of s
eacoast,
the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major
portion of them were Protestants. The lan
guage, the law, and the
literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the
colonists were engag
ed in the same hard task; that of conquering a
wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by

necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and
later against the French. They were all subj
ects of the same
sovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for
them and the English government
 supervised their local affairs, their
trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common
grievances 
vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.

Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
them 
into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them
were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their 
own land and tilled
it with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.
The majority of them were D
issenters, critics, not friends, of the
Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each
colony 
in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it
grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for i
tself. Here was a
people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to
strengthen the Church of England
 in America and the transformation of
colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
which they
 were designed to quench.

Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the
assistance of the governm
ent that irritated them. It was the protection
of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from
wip
ing out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were
controlled in the interests of the mother country,
 they also enjoyed
great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the
earth; but the broad empire o
f Britain was open to American ships and
merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
whic
h the colonists suffered through British regulation of their
industry and trade were more than offset by the privileg
es they enjoyed.
Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is
not necessarily the determin
ing factor in the fate of peoples. A
thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,
to insp
ire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a
destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of
 the British
empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
America would be richer under the 
British flag, could not change the
spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George
Washington.

PART II. CONFLICT AND INDEPENDENCE




CHAPTER V

THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY


On Octo
ber 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to
his young grandson. The first George, the son of th
e Elector of Hanover
and Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never
even learned to speak t
he language of the land over which he reigned.
The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke Engli
sh
with an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During
their reign, the principle had become well es
tablished that the king did
not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
Parliament.


GE
ORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM

=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the
German tradition of his 
family. He resented the imputation that he was a
foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympath
ies.
To the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular
phrase: "Born and educated in this country,
 I glory in the name of
Briton." Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for
high royal prerogative, 
said of George: "The young king was a born
Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No
port
ion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,
his appearance, and all that was known of his char
acter conciliated
public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were
pleasing; scandal imputed t
o him no vice; and flattery might without
glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues."

Nevertheless Geor
ge III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and
his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mig
hty
notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
the pretensions of Parliament and the minis
ters dependent upon it. His
mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: "George, be king!" Lord
Bute, his teacher and
 adviser, had told him that his honor required him
to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the mak
ing of
laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
him in the determination to rule as w
ell as reign, to subdue all
parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.

 an old print._

GEORGE III]

=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties
favored the pla
ns of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller

freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant
non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing thro
ugh long
continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
their own ranks. Their opponents, th
e Tories, had by this time given up
all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they
still cheris
hed their old notions about divine right. With the
accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to ra
lly
around the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open
arms, gave them offices, and bought them seat
s in the House of Commons.

=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British
Parliament at the t
ime made smooth the way for the king and his allies
with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the 
first
place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
number the king could increase by the 
appointment of his favorites, as
of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by
popular vote, the
y did not speak for the mass of English people. Great
towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had 
no
representatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants
in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only
 about 160,000 voters; that is
to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
government. Many bo
roughs returned one or more members to the Commons
although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances 
no
voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
lords who openly sold the right of repres
entation to the highest bidder.
The "rotten-boroughs," as they were called by reformers, were a public
scandal, but G
eorge III readily made use of them to get his friends into
the House of Commons.


GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR C
OLONIAL POLICIES

=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of
George III, William Pitt was tu
rned out of office, the king treating him
with "gross incivility" and the crowds shouting "Pitt forever!" The
directi
on of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's
confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George 
Grenville,
a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
cost of government.

The first tas
k after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood 
at the highest
point in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely
necessary and Grenville began to sear
ch for it, turning his attention
finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a
zealous colleagu
e, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public
service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal

governors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire
ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, "a new 
system of colonial
government. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more
requisitions from the king
 to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but
that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.
Coloni
al governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to
be supported by a standing army of twenty regiment
s; and all the
expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation."

=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).
=--Among the many complaints filed
before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
paper mon
ey by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a
remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colon
ial laws
authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This
law was aimed at the "cheap money" 
which the Americans were fond of
making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their
English cred
itors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written i
n the long
battle over sound money on this continent.

=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1
763)
George III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,
for the government of the territory recent
ly acquired by the treaty of
Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree
touched frontiersmen t
o the quick. The contests between the king's
officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
bee
n long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on
settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving we
st and
"squatting" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without
authority. To put an end to this, the 
king forbade all further purchases
from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
and dispo
se of them for settlement. A second provision in the same
proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the I
ndians,
including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in
the colonies. These two limitations o
n American freedom and enterprise
were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
preservation of the ri
ghts of the Indians against fraud and abuses.

=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their
at
tention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under
which England was laboring had been largely inc
urred in the defense of
America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
that the colonies should
 help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of thi
s
reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was
set forth clearly in the title: "An act for
 granting certain duties in
the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the
produce of such duti
es ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,
protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and
 for
more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
from the said colonies and plantations an
d improving and securing the
trade between the same and Great Britain." The old Molasses Act had been
prohibitive; th
e Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue
measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico,
 silks,
and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement
of the Molasses Act had been utterly n
eglected; but this Sugar Act had
"teeth in it." Special precautions as to bonds, security, and
registration of ship m
asters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised
a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.

The strict terms of th
e Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative
measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
ve
ssels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,
search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships app
roaching colonial
ports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in
America was instructed to be d
iligent in the execution of all trade and
navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
roy
al governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty
in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary mo
tives for the discharge
of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for
naval officers who seized
 offenders against the law were rewarded by
large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.

=The Stamp Act (1765)
.=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved
steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration

in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next
year it went through both Houses with a speed th
at must have astounded
its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;
while in the Lords it w
as not even necessary to go through the formality
of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure recei
ved
royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of
colonial agents in London were futile. "We
 might as well have hindered
the sun's progress!" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in
the Commons were
 equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and
from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a 
languid
interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful
measure attracted less notice than a
 bill providing for a commission to
act for the king when he was incapacitated.

The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, d
eclared the purpose of the British
government to raise revenue in America "towards defraying the expenses
of defendin
g, protecting, and securing the British colonies and
plantations in America." It was a long measure of more than fift
y
sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions
duties were imposed on practically all papers u
sed in legal
transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on
licenses to practice law and sell l
iquor, on college diplomas, playing
cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and
advertisements. The 
drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything
escaped.

=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware tha
t the Stamp
Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not
conjecture. While the measure was being d
ebated, a friend of General
Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous
warning in the Commons.
 "Believe me--remember I this day told you so--"
he exclaimed, "the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people
 at
first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties
and who will vindicate them, if ever they
 should be violated." The
answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.
Preparations were acco
rdingly made to dispatch a larger number of
soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
St
amp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the
colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers w
ho were to enforce
the new laws. "We have the power to tax them," said one of the ministry,
"and we will tax them."



COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL

=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an
outburst of den
unciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the
lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreein
g not to
import British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,
some of them incensed at the heavy t
axes on their operations and others
intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
papers, joined 
with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had
long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, prot
ested
against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old
England. There were Tories, however, in th
e colonies as in England--many
of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
Whig aristocr
ats as "seditious, factious and republican." Yet the
opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Qu
artering
Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.

In a little while it was taken up in the streets and alo
ng the
countryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,
there sprang up, as if by magic, comm
ittees and societies pledged to
resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were
known as Sons of
 Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including
artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic 
women. Both
groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
affairs. Many artisans, as well as 
all the women, were excluded from the
right to vote for colonial assemblymen.

While the merchants and Whig gentlemen
 confined their efforts chiefly to
drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of
Liberty opera
ted in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred
up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charlesto
n when attempts
were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of
high royal officers. They orga
nized committees of inquisition who by
threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use
of st
amped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations
to such excesses that many mild opponents of the 
stamp tax were
frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in 
a quieter way were making a very
effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
domestic industri
es, their own particular province being the manufacture
of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They h
elped to
feed and clothe their families without buying British goods.

=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--L
eaders in the colonial
assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the
popular protest. The 
Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,
the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declar
ing
that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
upon the inhabitants and that attempts t
o impose them otherwise were
"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust." It was in support of these
resolutions that Pat
rick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: "Caesar
had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III...." Cries 
of
"Treason" were calmly met by the orator who finished: "George III may
profit by their example. If that be treason,
 make the most of it."

[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]

=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered
 the call
of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to
be held in New York to discuss the
 situation. Nine colonies responded
and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest
affection f
or the king's person and government, firmly spread on record
a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meani
ng. They
declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given
through their respective colonial asse
mblies; that the Stamp Act showed
a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade
acts were b
urdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the
king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon mad
e "humble
supplication" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.

The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest
. It marked
the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.
It was the germ of a government wh
ich in time was to supersede the
government of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress
of the United
 States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt
at union. "There ought to be no New England men," declare
d Christopher
Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, "no New Yorkers known on the
Continent, but all of us Americans."


=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American
resistance on opinion in England was telling
. Commerce with the colonies
had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging
at the wharves;
 bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,
Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns
 of England
were thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was
reaping, in place of the coveted rev
enue, rebellion.

Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the
bar of the House of Commons, 
Benjamin Franklin, the agent for
Pennsylvania, who was in London. "Do you think it right," asked
Grenville, "that Ame
rica should be protected by this country and pay no
part of the expenses?" The answer was brief: "That is not the cas
e; the
colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five
thousand men and spent many millions." Then
 came an inquiry whether the
colonists would accept a modified stamp act. "No, never," replied
Franklin, "never! They
 will never submit to it!" It was next suggested
that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a re
ady
answer. "They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a
rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."


The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days
later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of c
ommerce interrupted, debts
due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,
workingmen unemplo
yed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the
colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close

of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor
of retracing the steps taken the year before.
 Grenville refused.
"America must learn," he wailed, "that prayers are not to be brought to
Caesar through riot and s
edition." His protests were idle. The Commons
agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
victo
rious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of
strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signe
d by the king, now
restored to his right mind.

In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention 
of
the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it
accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory
 Act. It announced that the
colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;
that the king and
 Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the

resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were
null and void.

The repeal was greeted by t
he colonists with great popular
demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and
trade resumed its
 normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper
resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again ch
eered
the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the
news that even the Sugar Act had been re
pealed, thus practically
restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend
inaugurated their policy o
f "thoroughness."


RESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES

=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph 
of the colonists was brief.
Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and
seated in the House
 of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness
gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parl
iament.
Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought
forward and pushed through both Houses of
 Parliament three measures,
which to this day are associated with his name. First among his
restrictive laws was that
 of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement
of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and expor
ts
in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in
the colonies, paid from the British treas
ury, and independent of all
control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a
tax on lead, glas
s, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into
the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied
 toward
the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
officials. A third measure was the Tea Act o
f July 2, 1767, aimed at the
tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This
law abolished t
he duty which the East India Company had to pay in
England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that Englis
h tea
merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea
smugglers.

=Writs of Assistance Legalized by P
arliament.=--Had Parliament been
content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,
and neglecte
d their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of
the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict,
 even the
harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at
their posts and put an end to smugg
ling. In the revenue act of June 29,
1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
issue "writ
s of assistance," empowering customs officers to enter "any
house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the Bri
tish colonies
or plantations in America to search for and seize" prohibited or
smuggled goods.

The writ of assistanc
e, which was a general search warrant issued to
revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who
cheri
shed the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a "
minion of the law"
to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much
for the emotions of people
 who had fled to America in a quest for
self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to
establish th
em, and who wanted to trade without official interference.

The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 
1755 to prevent
illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
time. In 1761 it was again the 
subject of a bitter controversy which
arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
Massachusett
s court for writs of assistance "as usual." This application
was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hou
rs' duration--a
speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
away "ready to take up arms aga
inst writs of assistance." Otis denounced
the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
his 
head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the
liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty 
officer to work
possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to
spread terror and desolation 
through the land. "What a scene," he
exclaimed, "does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
or wanton
ness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a
writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defens
e; one arbitrary
exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
blood." He did more than attac
k the writ itself. He said that Parliament
could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.
Th
is was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly
echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis
 sounded the call to
America to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.
"Then and there," wrote Joh
n Adams, "the child Independence was born."
Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of

customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.

=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month
 that Townshend's
Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.
The assembly of New York, 
protesting against the "ruinous and
insupportable" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the
care of Bri
tish troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering
Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it 
promised to
obey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance
with the Quartering Act was wrun
g from the reluctant province. In the
meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
represen
tative bodies rested.


RENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA

=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the

leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed
intervention in America. At his suggestion the 
assembly adopted a
Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
informing them of the state of a
ffairs in Massachusetts and roundly
condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that
Parliamen
t had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent
and that the colonists could not, from the nature of t
he case, be
represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to
consideration the question as to whether any 
people could be called free
who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
paid out of funds r
aised independently. It invited the other colonies,
in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common
pre
dicament in which they were all placed.

[Illustration: _From an old print._

SAMUEL ADAMS]

=The Dissolution of Asse
mblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing
of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. 
On
meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and
South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circu
lar Letter and were also
dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
passed resolutions o
n May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of
imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting 
anew
the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of
persons accused of crimes or trial beyond t
he seas, and beseeching the
king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution
of the Virginia a
ssembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal
governor.

=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the Briti
sh authorities
kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of
citizens searched, and troops distrib
uted in increasing numbers among
the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British
goods, the S
ons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about
the patronage of home products still more loyally.

On th
e night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to
jostle and tease some British regulars stationed 
in the town. Things
went from bad to worse until some "boys and young fellows" began to
throw snowballs and stones. T
hen the exasperated soldiers fired into the
crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the
"ma
ssacre," a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was
sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The 
governor hesitated
and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded
and ordered the regulars a
way.

The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.
Popular passions ran high. The guilty so
ldiers were charged with murder.
Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by
John Adams a
nd Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst

offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speec
h to the
jury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,
saying, that "from the nature of thin
gs soldiers quartered in a populous
town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one." Two of
the soldi
ers were convicted and lightly punished.

=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some
cit
izens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,
openly resisted his authority. Many were killed
 as a result and seven
who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal
troops and local militi
a met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,
called the "Lexington of the South."

=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Vir
ginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as
well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists
broke o
ut into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for
smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_
, ran ashore and was
caught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the
vessel and, after seizing 
the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,
sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to
accoun
t, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very
appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots
 of Virginia to
action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution
creating a standing committee 
of correspondence to develop cooperation
among the colonies in resistance to British measures.

=The Boston Tea Party
.=--Although the British government, finding the
Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties exc
ept
that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
commercial regulations it had imposed on the c
olonies. Moreover,
Parliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the
financial difficulties into wh
ich it had fallen partly by reason of the
Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to
return
 to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on
all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of t
hree pence, to be
collected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
in the Declaratory Act that
 Parliament had the right to tax the
colonists.

This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the
co
lonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one
thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For anot
her thing, it
promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of
cheap tea and so cause heavy lo
sses to American merchants who had large
stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who
were e
ngaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an
irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charle
ston, Annapolis, New
York, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
roughly handled. One nig
ht in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,
disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the car
go
into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,
determined violation of the law. As such th
e British government viewed
it.


RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT

=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--Th
e news of the tea riot in
Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no
soft policy in deali
ng with his American subjects. "The die is cast," he
stated with evident satisfaction. "The colonies must either triu
mph or
submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very
meek." Lord George Germain characterize
d the tea party as "the
proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had
the least prudence, to 
follow their mercantile employments and not
trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not
unders
tand." This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of
Lord North, who had then for three years been the k
ing's chief minister.
Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in
upholding its authority.

=T
he Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,
passed five stringent measures, known in America
n history as the five
"intolerable acts." They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The
_first_ of them was a 
bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to
commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,
revo
ked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that
the councilors should be appointed by the king, t
hat all judges should
be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect
certain officers) could
 not be held without the governor's consent. A
_third_ measure, after denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful

government" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to
Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of
 officers or other
persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.
The _fourth_ act legalize
d the quartering of troops in Massachusetts
towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted
reli
gious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries
of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and estab
lished, in this western
region, government by a viceroy.

The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordi
nary
celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was
ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against th
e Boston port bill,
condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and
showing how likely it was t
o bring grave consequences in its train. He
was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both

houses without a division, the entry "unanimous" being made upon their
journals although it did not accurately repres
ent the state of opinion.
The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a
vote of three to on
e; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. "What passed in 
Boston,"
exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, "is the overt act of High
Treason proceeding from our over lenit
y and want of foresight." The
crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.

In the colonies th
e laws were received with consternation. To the
American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That
pro
ject they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of
 Great Britain. The
British government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics
either at home or in Ireland a
nd the Americans could see no good motive
in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because
Massach
usetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,
large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.

T
o enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British
government was brought into play. The commander-in-c
hief of the armed
forces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of
Massachusetts. Reinforcements were broug
ht to the colonies, for now King
George was to give "the rebels," as he called them, a taste of strong
medicine. The 
majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.


FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA

=The Doctrine of Natural Ri
ghts.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the
destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
a 
new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the
British ministry, the Americans spoke of their "
rights as Englishmen"
and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the
principles of the English co
nstitution under which they all lived. When
they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned
for
 support to their "natural rights." The latter doctrine, in the form
in which it was employed by the colonists, was a
s English as the
constitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in
defense of the English revolutio
n in the seventeenth century. American
leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in
the h
our of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did
not rest after all upon the English constitution or
 a charter from the
crown. "Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things," retorted
Otis when the constitution
al argument failed. "A time may come when
Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,
inhe
rent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
would remain and whatever became of charters can
 never be abolished
until the general conflagration." Of the same opinion was the young and
impetuous Alexander Hamil
ton. "The sacred rights of mankind," he
exclaimed, "are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records.
 They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can neve
r be erased or
obscured by mortal power."

Firm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their
ri
ghts, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they
hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of op
inion. They constantly
avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
language against his 
policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a
firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning

concessions from England. "I argue this cause with the greater
pleasure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the
 writs of
assistance, "as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in
opposition to a kind of power, the ex
ercise of which in former periods
cost one king of England his head and another his throne."

=Burke Offers the Doctr
ine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of
American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,
Edm
und Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
American democracy were efforts to reverse the proce
sses of nature. He
saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American
spirit--how inevitable, how irre
sistible. He warned his countrymen that
there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only
three. One
 was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spi
rit was grounded
in the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to
prosecute American leaders as cri
minals; of this he begged his
countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that "a government
against which a clai
m of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
government to which submission is equivalent to slavery." The third a
nd
right way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the
American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, 
and receive the colonies
into equal partnership.

=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by B
urke,
was equally impossible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To
their narrow minds, American opinion wa
s contemptible and American
resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their
view, was to dis
patch more troops to crush the "rebels"; and that very
act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams 
said:
"Facts are stubborn things." Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers
were visible to the veriest street urc
hin. "Now," said Gouverneur
Morris, "the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
It was too late 
to talk about the excellence of the British
constitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
his
torians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his
understanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately o
ration, _On
Conciliation with America_.

CHAPTER VI

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION


RESISTANCE AND R
ETALIATION

=The Continental Congress.=--When the news of the "intolerable acts"
reached America, every one knew what
 strong medicine Parliament was
prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority. The
cause of Massachu
setts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition
to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a
 national
character. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a
Continental Congress, appropriately c
alled by Massachusetts on June 17,
1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons
was electric
. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly ass
embled in
Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America
were there--George Washington and Pat
rick Henry from Virginia and John
and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was
represented. Some w
ere impatient with mild devices; the majority favored
moderation.

The Congress drew up a declaration of American rig
hts and stated in
clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It
approved the resistance to British
 measures offered by Massachusetts and
promised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to
King Ge
orge and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of
independence but firmly attacking the policies purs
ued by the British
government.

=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,
with profess
ions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary
step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods 
into America,
and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
"committees of safety and inspect
ion," to be elected by the qualified
voters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw
itself athwar
t British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and
to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up
 a state within
the British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.
The colonists, who up to this 
moment had been wavering, had to choose
one authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the
non-importat
ion agreement or they were against it. They either bought
English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--
"May Britain
be wise and America be free"--the first Continental Congress adjourned
in October, having appointed the 
tenth of May following for the meeting
of a second Congress, should necessity require.

=Lord North's "Olive Branch."
=--When the news of the action of the
American Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal
of the 
obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime
minister, Lord North, was a set of "conciliatory res
olutions" proposing
to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
imperial defense and make prov
ision for supporting the local officers of
the crown. This "olive branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
th
e king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in 
effect destroyed the
commerce of New England.

=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the

British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, he
aring that military
stores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize
them. By this act he prec
ipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.
At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred "the little thing" that

produced "the great event." An unexpected collision beyond the thought
or purpose of any man had transferred the cont
est from the forum to the
battle field.

=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war
was a
ctually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at
Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that 
conciliation was
beyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
colonists in order that the
 empire might avoid the calamities of civil
war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to
Lord
 North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was
unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to
 tax or repeal
the offensive acts of Parliament.

=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of Americ
a
were about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on
August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamatio
n of rebellion. This
announcement declared that the colonists, "misled by dangerous and
ill-designing men," were in a
 state of insurrection; it called on the
civil and military powers to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
threate
ned with "condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and
abettors of such traitorous designs." It closed with the 
usual prayer:
"God, save the king." Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping
act destroying all trade and inte
rcourse with America. Congress was
silent at last. Force was also America's answer.


AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE

=Driftin
g into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of
reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it 
had firmly resolved
to defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the
militiamen who had assembled n
ear Boston, after the battle of Lexington,
into a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.
It 
assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage
war, and carry on diplomatic relations with fore
ign countries.

[Illustration: _From an old print_

SPIRIT OF 1776]

Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the 
American militia, by
the stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British
regulars pay dearly for a
ll they got. On July 3, Washington took command
of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointme
nts
in drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,
the British government concluded a treaty
 with the Landgrave of
Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands
of soldiers and many 
pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to
America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both s
ides
of the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative
historian Lecky: "The conduct of Englan
d in hiring German mercenaries to
subdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made
reconciliation h
opeless and independence inevitable." The news of this
wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached Ame
rica
before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington
had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, com
pelling Lord Howe to sail with
his entire army for Halifax.

=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence
.=--Events were
bearing the Americans away from their old position under the British
constitution toward a final sepa
ration. Slowly and against their
desires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united
them to the o
ld order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great de
cision. In
all parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour
was being debated. "American inde
pendence," as the historian Bancroft
says, "was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
assembly.
 It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishe
rmen along the
coast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the
pulpit; at social gatherings and
 around the camp fires; in county
conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and
assemblies."


[Illustration: _From an old print_

THOMAS PAINE]

=Paine's "Commonsense."=--In the midst of this ferment of America
n
opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
public with a program for absolute independen
ce, without fears and
without apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the
first of his famous tract
s, "Commonsense," a passionate attack upon the
British monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.

Casting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hitherto
addressed George III, Paine went to the othe
r extreme and assailed him
with many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system
which had laid the w
orld "in blood and ashes." Instead of praising the
British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their

rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was "owing
to the constitution of the people, not to t
he constitution of the
government, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in
Turkey."

Having thus summari
ly swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
s
eparation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of
practical interest, he insisted, which should bind t
he colonies to the
mother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
in which they had been in
volved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty
in behalf of independence. "Our corn will fetch its price in any marke
t
in Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we
will." As to matters of government, "it is not
 in the power of Britain
to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too
weighty and intricate to b
e managed with any tolerable degree of
convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us."

There 
is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.
"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation
. The blood of
the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...
Arms, the last resort, must deci
de the contest; the appeal was the
choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The
sun never
 shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a
city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a contin
ent.... 'Tis not
the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the
contest and will be more or les
s affected to the end of time by the
proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and
honor....
 O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the
tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig
 and Tory be
extinct. Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,
an open and resolute friend, and
 a virtuous supporter of the rights of
mankind and of the free and independent states of America." As more than
100,0
00 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots
exclaimed with Washington: "Sound doctrine and unanswer
able reason!"

=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the
idea of independence began to com
e from many quarters. On the tenth of
February, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,
advoca
ted a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
for all America. The convention balked at the latter 
but went half way
by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
complete plan of self-governmen
t. A month later, on April 12, the
neighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
others sh
rank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to
concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declarin
g
independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly
responded to the challenge. The convention of the O
ld Dominion, on May
15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence
of the United Colonies a
nd to give the assent of Virginia to the act of
separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the
s
tate house was lowered for all time.

Meanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events
outside. T
he subject of independence was constantly being raised. "Are
we rebels?" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate 
in February.
"No: we must declare ourselves a free people." Others hesitated and
spoke of waiting for the arrival of 
commissioners of conciliation. "Is
not America already independent?" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.
"Why not t
hen declare it?" Still there was uncertainty and delegates
avoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last
, on May 10,
Congress declared that the authority of the British crown in America
must be suppressed and advised the 
colonies to set up governments of
their own.

[Illustration: _From an old print_

THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT 
OF THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]

=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepare
d, therefore, when,
on June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that "these
united colonies are and of r
ight ought to be free and independent
states." A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
document setti
ng forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the
states save New York went on record in favor of severing thei
r political
connection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft
of the Declaration of Independen
ce, changed in some slight particulars,
was adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang
out 
the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will
 to have a place among
the powers of the world.

To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independe
nce
is one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but
patriotism alone does not make it immortal
. Neither does the vigor of
its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
the records of t
ime. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of 
a political
ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
throughout the earth, challenging king
s and potentates, shaking down
thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
battle fields
 as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That
ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the si
mple
sentence: "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed."

Written in a "decent respect
 for the opinions of mankind," to set forth
the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from
Britain
, the Declaration contained a long list of "abuses and
usurpations" which had induced them to throw off the governmen
t of King
George. That section of the Declaration has passed into "ancient"
history and is seldom read. It is the par
t laying down a new basis for
government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
household phras
e in the Old World as in the New.

In the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,
from the sta
ndpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of
revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowe
d by their
Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness; (2) the pur
pose of government is to secure these
rights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
govern
ed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the right of the people to alter or a
bolish it and
institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and
organizing its powers in such f
orm as to them shall seem most likely to
effect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic
dram
a of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every
privilege not founded on popular assent.


THE ESTA
BLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE

=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed int
o
armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
forces by organizing civil government. This 
was readily effected, for
the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and
committees of corresp
ondence. The working tools of the Revolution were
in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial

groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.
As early as November, 1772, such a committee
 had been created in Boston
under the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent
emissaries to neighb
oring towns, and carried on a campaign of education
in the doctrines of liberty.

[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORT
H AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]

Upon local organizations similar in character to the Bosto
n committee
were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,
congresses, and conventions, all un
official and representing the
revolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
the old legisla
tive assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblie
s was
built the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the
Articles of Confederation and ultimately under
 the Constitution of the
United States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the
British empire in Ame
rica.

=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of
the people, the old colonial governmen
ts broke down. From the royal
provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,
and it became 
necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to
the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of governme
nt for
themselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.
Before the expiration of a year, Virg
inia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions
as states, no
t as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and
Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were eq
ual to their
needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
before so far as the form of governm
ent was concerned. South Carolina,
which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
complete 
constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much
deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which 
in most of its
essential features remains unchanged to-day.

The new state constitutions in their broad outlines foll
owed colonial
models. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
chosen usually by the legislatur
e; but in two instances, New York and
Massachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was
substitute
d, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or
assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old p
roperty
restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was
continued in full force to the great
 discontent of the mechanics thus
deprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several
constituti
ons, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated
that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any
 radical
experiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John
Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry 
Corbin of Virginia, against a
government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
mild curiosities o
f no significance, although in New Jersey women were
allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.

By the
 new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of
authority derived from any source save "the people,
" were swept aside
and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
time to the modern world. 
Copies of these remarkable documents prepared
by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in

Europe. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
a generation of constitution-makers whose mis
sion it was to begin the
democratic revolution in the Old World.

=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of 
state constitutions
was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build
on foundations already lai
d. The establishment of a national system of
government was another matter. There had always been, it must be
remembe
red, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans
had had little experience in its operation. When th
e supervision of the
crown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,
accustomed merely to provincial
 statesmanship, were poorly trained for
action on a national stage.

Many forces worked against those who, like Frank
lin, had a vision of
national destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce
and industry in the Nort
h and the planting system of the South. There
were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops

for common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local
pride, the vested rights of state and village po
liticians in their
provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
the common enterprise.

Neve
rtheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly op
ened its work
before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
permanent connection. As early as
 July, 1775, Congress resolved to go
into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,
undaunted
 by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again
presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory
 debates followed
and it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states
the Articles of Confederati
on. Provincial jealousies delayed
ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the
surrender of C
ornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the
states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it wa
s all
that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a
chief executive nor a system of federal c
ourts. It created simply a
Congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
the right to call
 upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
government--money and soldiers.

=The Application of Tests of Allegian
ce.=--As the successive steps were
taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised
and applied
 tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
the new nation in the process of making. When the first
 Continental
Congress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it
provided for the creation of local com
mittees to enforce the rules. Such
agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all
opponents 
being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those
who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and 
warned or
punished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state
constitutions were put into effect, local com
mittees set to work in the
same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
the new order of thi
ngs.

[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]

These patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,
were
 sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to
sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "
association test."
Those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the
more dangerous were thrown i
nto jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at
one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New
York
. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The
black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearl
y five hundred
persons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who
were bold enough to speak and 
write against the Revolution were
suppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in
the North, t
he property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.

The work of th
e official agencies for suppression of opposition was
sometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hange
d without
trial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake
of ice and held there "until his lo
yalty to King George might cool."
Whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
they could 
within the British lines or into Canada, where the British
government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by
 Washington,
but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well
as a war for independence, was 
being waged.

=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who
were to be citizens of the new r
epublic were separated from those who
preferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the
Americans 
favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question o
f revolution
was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have
conflicting evidence. On the patr
iot side, there is the testimony of a
careful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds
of the 
people were for the American cause and not more than one-third
opposed the Revolution at all stages.

On behalf of th
e loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,
extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a me
mber of
the first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its
temper, testified before a committee o
f Parliament in 1779 that not
one-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that
"many more than fo
ur-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great
Britain upon constitutional principles to independence." At the sam
e
time General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,
declared that "more than two-thirds of the peop
le would prefer the
king's government to the Congress' tyranny." In an address to the king
in that year a committee o
f American loyalists asserted that "the number
of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
enlis
ted by Congress to oppose them."

=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,
more than a 
thousand people fled with him. This great company, according
to a careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the p
rovince by
virtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and
professions; of their hereditary wealth and
 of their culture." The act
of banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,
"reads like the s
ocial register of the oldest and noblest families of
New England," more than one out of five being graduates of Harva
rd
College. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that
the leading loyalists were prominent officia
ls of the old order,
clergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought
against the inevitable or wit
h anguish of heart they left as refugees
for a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.

=Tories Assail t
he Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined
the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the
 royal
cause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
editorials, rhymes, satires, and politica
l catechisms. They declared
that the members of Congress were "obscure, pettifogging attorneys,
bankrupt shopkeepers,
 outlawed smugglers, etc." The people and their
leaders they characterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
d
regs of mankind." The generals in the army they sneered at as "men of
rank and honor nearly on a par with those of th
e Congress."

=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,
patriot writers devoted themselves
 to creating and sustaining a public
opinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat
the depres
sion that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
war. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Mo
ntgomery in the
winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a
disaster that cost 5000 men; 
repeated calamities harassed Washington in
1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and
b
eaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost
too great for the stoutest patriots.

Pamphletee
rs, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs
of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College 
of New Jersey,
forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,
Philip Freneau, flung taunts o
f cowardice at the Tories and celebrated
the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,
and sa
tires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,
battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps t
aken by Congress
afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.
"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against 
oppression?" anxiously inquired John
Adams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. "The clergy of
every den
omination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten
every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts.
 They thank God
most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray
for the American army."

Thomas
 Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of
Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were h
arried from New
Jersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the
army as well as on the public. I
n December, 1776, he made a second great
appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, "The Crisis," the first part
of wh
ich he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This
tract was a cry for continued support of the Revol
ution. "These are the
times that try men's souls," he opened. "The summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in t
his crisis, shrink from the service of his
country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
and
 women." Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every
one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, se
lf-interested fear." He
deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He
refuted the charge that
 the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster
and he promised victory soon. "By perseverance and fortitude," he
conc
luded, "we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and
submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a
 ravaged country, a
depopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without
hope.... Look on this picture an
d weep over it." His ringing call to
arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
over.


MILI
TARY AFFAIRS

=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of
Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and
 closed with the surrender of
Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct
phases--the fir
st lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in
1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During th
e first
phase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding
features of the contest were the evacuation 
of Boston by the British,
the expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through
New Jersey, the ba
ttle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the
British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne a
nd his
capture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American
forces at Valley Forge for the terrible w
inter of 1777-78.

The final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with
France on February 6, 1778, w
as confined mainly to the Middle states,
the West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events
were
 the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of
Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New Yor
k by deploying
American forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the
West, George Rogers Clark, by hi
s famous march into the Illinois
country, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
country between
 the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second
period opened with successes for the British. They captured S
avannah,
conquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized
Charleston, administered a crushing 
defeat to the American forces under
Gates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at
Cowpens a
nd King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis
began the last of his operations. He pursued General Gre
ene far into
North Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the
coast, took charge of British f
orces engaged in plundering Virginia, and
fortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the
sea
 and the combined French and American forces on land.

=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the th
eater of
the war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from
Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of a
lmost a thousand miles. It was
nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though
the British nav
y kept the channel open, transports were constantly
falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels.
 The
sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between
points along the coast and gave ready ac
cess to the American centers of
wealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early
forced to give
 up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end
of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until t
hreatened by
the approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both
Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however
, are seldom won by the conquest
of cities.

Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small
p
ortion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the
coast were in no way dependent upon them for a
 livelihood. They lived on
the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact
gave strength to th
em in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far
from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was
 forced
to surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
base of supplies. As soon as the Brit
ish got away from Charleston, they
were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,
and Pickens
. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far
in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region
 he had invaded.
Sustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their
armies could readily retreat, s
upplied mainly from native resources, the
Americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
blow
.

=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting
off American trade, but control of the sea d
id not seriously affect the
United States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was
not such a vital 
matter. All the materials for a comfortable though
somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference t
o a
nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were
cut off. This was an evil to which submi
ssion was necessary.

Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry
materially change the 
situation. They demonstrated the skill of American
seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of

British marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive
, were the deeds of the
hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply
ships and kept Britis
h merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the
French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled t
o
reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
possibilities of a maritime disaster.

=Co
mmanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is
difficult to compare the contending forces in the revo
lutionary contest.
There is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience
in the art of warfare. Si
r William Howe had served in America during the
French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict
disciplin
arian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,
society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, 
his failure to
overwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York
and Philadelphia, destroyed eve
ry shred of his military reputation. John
Burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from
Canada, h
ad likewise seen service in the French War both in America and
Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in 
his nature and
after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,
he devoted his time mainly to l
ight literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who
directed the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,
had "
learned his trade on the continent," and was regarded as a man of
discretion and understanding in military matters. L
ord Cornwallis, whose
achievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
Yorktown, had seen ser
vice in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted
talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
I
ndia. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,
they all had training and experience to guide the
m.

[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]

The Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been
interested in
 military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty year
s before. He
had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of
the British generals. He was a ste
rn but reasonable disciplinarian. He
was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or
depression at
 reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, "what held
the patriot forces together?" asks Beveridge in his _Life o
f John
Marshall_. Then he answers: "George Washington and he alone. Had he
died or been seriously disabled, the Revol
ution would have ended....
Washington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the
government. Washington w
as the Revolution." The weakness of Congress in
furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at

ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him
such as the "Conway cabal," the cowardice of
 Lee at Monmouth, even the
treason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his
breast and aroused him
 to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did
not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war thr
ough
to the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was
immeasurable.

Of the generals who served under hi
m, none can really be said to have
been experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the
unhappy tr
aitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book
seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexingt
on called
him to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a "seasoned soldier"
because he had entered the British arm
y as a youth, had been wounded at
Braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven
Years' War
; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.
The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and
 his crushing
defeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael
Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and
 smith without military experience
who, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and
took up 
the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South
Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief 
but desperate brush
with the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the
heroes of Cowpens, had be
en a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen
some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military
know
ledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was
negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at 
Durham, New
Hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
lay down his briefs and take up the
 sword. Anthony Wayne was a
Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,
read a few books
 on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for
service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders
, and
it is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and
Indians, but none of them had seen warfar
e on a large scale with regular
troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European
experience. Courage, n
ative ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of
the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fou
ght
during the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the
balance.

=Foreign Officers in American Service.
=--To native genius was added
military talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in
the iron regime o
f Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined
Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoe
uvered the
men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
soldiers. From France came young Lafaye
tte and the stern De Kalb, from
Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war
as waged in E
urope and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.
Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied
 by
several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the
war sharing the hardships of American ar
my life. Pulaski fell at the
siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American
war to defend i
n vain the independence of his native land. To these
distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with Ame
rican
revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which
fitted raw recruits and temperamental 
militiamen to cope with a military
power of the first rank.

=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were con
cerned their
annals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who
were sent over at the opening of th
e contest, the recruits drummed up
by special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought
outright by King 
George presented few problems of management to the
British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home an
d
enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
of them experienced in actual campaigns. Th
e armies of King George
fought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth
demonstrate. Many a m
an and subordinate officer and, for that matter,
some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against

their own kin; but they obeyed orders.

The Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim
determination,
 as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in
discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war br
oke
in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no
continental army; there were only local band
s of militiamen, many of
them experienced in fighting but few of them "regulars" in the military
sense. Moreover they
 were volunteers serving for a short time,
unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints
imposed
 on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually
leaving the service just at the most critical moments. 
"The militia,"
lamented Washington, "come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell
where; consume your provisions
; exhaust your stores; and leave you at
last at a critical moment."

Again and again Washington begged Congress to pr
ovide for an army of
regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to
some definite plan. At l
ast he was able to overcome, in part at least,
the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that
reluc
tant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
bonus to all privates who served until the end of the 
war. Even this
scheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the
soldiers, did not produce quick resul
ts. It was near the close of the
conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of
meeting Briti
sh regulars on equal terms.

Though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
effective work,
 it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
f
orces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did
nothing of the sort. For the victories of Benningt
on, Trenton, Saratoga,
and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White
Plains, Germantown, and
 Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen
overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.

"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier," wrote
Washington, "requires time.... To expect the
 same service from raw and
undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
did and perhaps ne
ver will happen."

=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For
one thing there were delay
s and blunders on the part of the British
generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with
large b
odies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted th
e American
army. "Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
us," solemnly averred Washington 
in 1780. Still it is fair to say that
this apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The
ministers
 behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction
 rather than by a
war vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
better than conquest, and t
he slighter the wounds the quicker the
healing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were
thrown 
into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things
about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along,
 the British were
embarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage
with the skill of militiamen,
 as they were in unfamiliar territory. The
long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
warship
s of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply
boats.

The British were in fact battered and worn do
wn by a guerrilla war and
outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and
Yorktown. Stern fact
s convinced them finally that an immense army, which
could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to 
subdue
the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.
They learned also that America would t
hen be alienated, fretful, and the
scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a
price whi
ch staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there
were forces of opposition at home with which they had to
 reckon.

=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent
to the struggle for independence. Wh
en it was confined to the realm of
opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth
Timothee,
 for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to
espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the 
sister of James
Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case
upon their natural rights, an
d in influential circles she urged the
leaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing
about 
with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing
letters to him declaring her faith in "independenc
y."

When the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In
sustaining public sentiment they were a
ctive. Mrs. Warren with a
tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.
Almost every revolut
ionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
service in the "second line of defense." Mrs. Washington managed th
e
plantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the
rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge
--an inspiration to her
husband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah
Bache, while her father wa
s pleading the American cause in France, set
the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even
n
ear the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling
powder to the front, and carrying dispatches 
at the peril of their
lives.

In the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested
crops without 
enjoying the picturesque title of "farmerettes" and they
canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of wa
r. Of their
labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: "Immediately on being cut
off from the use of English manuf
actures, the women engaged within their
own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
They t
hus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than
 make for
themselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry
and strict economy frequently support
ed the whole domestic circle,
evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
service."

For their w
ar work, women were commended by high authorities on more
than one occasion. They were given medals and public testim
onials even
as in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid
tribute to them for the inspiration 
and material aid which they had
given to the cause of independence.


THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION

When the Revolu
tion opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in
America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Cong
ress was
in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority
to lay and collect taxes directly a
nd knowing the hatred of the
provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
finance the war
. "Do you think," boldly inquired one of the delegates,
"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when 
we can send
to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will
pay for the whole?"

=Paper Money a
nd Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political
economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollar
s in bills of
credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
populations. Other issues followed
 in quick succession. In all about
$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several
states added n
early $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came
interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millio
ns
were also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In
desperation a national lottery was held, 
producing meager results. The
property of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about
$16,000,000. Begging let
ters were sent to the states asking them to
raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened
wit
h their own affairs, gave little heed.

=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it
rapid
ly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts 
were made by
Congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
value; but these were like attempts
 to make water flow uphill.
Speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
republic. Fortunes were 
made and lost gambling on the prices of public
securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valle
y
Forge. "Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling," exclaimed
Washington, "afford too many melancholy proof
s of the decay of public
virtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency
... aided by stock job
bing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
the enemy."

=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in
 financing the
war were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant
of Philadelphia, supplied memb
ers of Congress, including Madison,
Jefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with
money for th
eir daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of
half a million dollars to the American cause and died br
oken in purse,
if not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia
merchant, Robert Morris, won for him
self the name of the "patriot
financier" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
the bills which p
oured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own
funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced i
n the
handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to
distribute supplies to the troops, thus dis
playing administrative as
well as financial talents.

[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]

Women organized "drives" for mon
ey, contributed their plate and their
jewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in
return
 for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrif
ices of citizens,
the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,
borrowings in Europe, and the impres
sment of supplies, the Congress
staggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
next meal is to 
be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
kindly fate.


THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION

When the ful
l measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
their commanding officers, the civilians who managed fina
nces and
supplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women
who did well their part, there yet re
mains the duty of recognizing the
achievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was
keenly appr
eciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were
fairly well versed in European history. They knew of th
e balance of
power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their
rulers. All this information th
ey turned to good account, in opening
relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and
even mili
tary assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,
they created a secret committee on foreign correspond
ence as early as
1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.

=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France w
as inclining a
friendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a
commissioner to Paris, Silas 
Deane of Connecticut, often styled the
"first American diplomat." Later in the year a form of treaty to be
presented 
to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and
Deane were selected as American representatives at the 
court of "His
Most Christian Majesty the King of France." John Jay of New York was
chosen minister to Spain in 1779; 
John Adams was sent to Holland the
same year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and
Berlin. The r
epresentative selected for St. Petersburg spent two
fruitless years there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity
 and
experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure." Frederick the Great,
king of Prussia, expressed a desire to f
ind in America a market for
Silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,
he refused to giv
e direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.

=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution
wa
s won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,
although many circumstances prepared the way for 
his success. Louis
XVI's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any
American representative, had
 brought to the attention of the king the
opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her
colo
nies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and
"reduce the power and greatness of England"--the empi
re that in 1763 had
forced upon her a humiliating peace "at the price of our possessions,
of our commerce, and our cr
edit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,
Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal." Equally successful in
gaini
ng the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,
Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the auth
or of two
popular plays, "Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." These two men had
already urged upon the king secret a
id for America before Deane appeared
on the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential
arrangements to f
urnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to
the struggling colonies, although official requests for them we
re
officially refused by the French government.

=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received o
nly
in private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,
however, made manifest their affection for the "
plain republican" in
"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet." He was known among
men of letters as an auth
or, a scientist, and a philosopher of
extraordinary ability. His "Poor Richard" had thrice been translated
into Frenc
h and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, phi
losophers,
peasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in
his mission. The queen, Marie Antoin
ette, fated to lose her head in a
revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging "our dear
republican."


For the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England
resented the presence of this "traitor" in P
aris, and Louis had to be
cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
disastrously. Moreover, the ea
rly period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris
was a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant
exploit
 at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with
Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster a
t Brandywine,
the loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement
to Valley Forge for the winter o
f 1777-78. New York City and
Philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson
and Delaware rivers
 were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British
troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New Yor
k,
cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the
king was cautious. Then the unexpected happen
ed. Burgoyne, hemmed in
from all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging
parties beaten back, 
his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,
1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time 
to
receive the honor.

=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,
placed by historians among 
the fifteen decisive battles of the world,
reached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends
sat
 gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once
the meaning of the situation and set off to the 
court at Versailles with
such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and
his ministers were a
t last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and si
gned
in February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized
by France and an alliance was formed to 
guarantee that independence.
Combined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally
declared war on England
. Men who had, a few short years before, fought
one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of
Abr
aham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt
had erected and that George III was pulling down.


=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering
the steady decline of her sea power since th
e days of the Armada and
hoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the
concert of nations agains
t England. Holland, a member of a league of
armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high
sea
s, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and
America to prey upon British commerce. To all this t
rouble for England
was added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit
of independence was flaming
 up.

=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be
joined by France in a common war on the
 English empire, Lord North
proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn
enactment, Parliament d
eclared its intention not to exercise the right
of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized

the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.
A truce was to be established, pardons gran
ted, objectionable laws
suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the
opening of hostilities, 
restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events
had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British
commissi
oners and diplomats.

=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,
large sums of gold and silv
er, loads of supplies, and a considerable
body of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this
he
lp, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British
evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the 
alliance, and
Washington's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They
inflicted a heavy blow on the Bri
tish at Monmouth, but the treasonable
conduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of
Philadelphi
a was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of
Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates a
t Camden.

The full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when
Cornwallis went into Virginia and set
tled at Yorktown. Accompanied by
French troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British
to the shore
 while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.
It was this movement, which certainly could not have bee
n executed
without French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British
dominion in America. It was the sur
render of Cornwallis at Yorktown that
caused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: "It is all over! It is
all ove
r!" What might have been done without the French alliance lies
hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the he
lp of French
soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the
earth. "All the world agree," exul
tantly wrote Franklin from Paris to
General Washington, "that no expedition was ever better planned or
better execute
d. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
the latest posterity." Diplomacy as well as martial valor 
had its
reward.


PEACE AT LAST

=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to
the final disc
omfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to
remember that from the beginning to the end the British mi
nistry at home
faced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were
vigorous protests, first against the
 obnoxious acts which precipitated
the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,
and finally 
against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thunder
ed
against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.
William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he 
deplored the idea of American
independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
American resist
ance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against
every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which
, while
giving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather
than estrangement. Charles James Fox gav
e the colonies his generous
sympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of
statesmen there wer
e stout friends of the American cause like David
Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an auth
or
of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in
seeing it through.

Against this powerful opp
osition, the government enlisted a whole army
of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and
t
heir friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,
was so savage that even the ministers had to ton
e down his pamphlets
before printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in
time to win fame as the his
torian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a
l
ucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his
friends to ridicule him in these lines:

    "King G
eorge, in a fright
     Lest Gibbon should write
       The story of England's disgrace,
     Thought no way so sure

     His pen to secure
       As to give the historian a place."

=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore 
heavily on the side
of the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that
conquest was impossible, a
nd they had urged the advantages of a peace
which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.
Ever
y day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their
arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of 
an effort to relieve
English burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses
were daily increasing. 
Trade with the colonies, the greatest single
outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due

British merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an
indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge 
of revolution. The French
had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in
December, 1781, that
 no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and
 on
February 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the
throne against continuing the war. Burke
, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,
and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North
gave notice th
en that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:
"Necessity made me yield."

In April, 1782, Franklin received wo
rd from the English government that
it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This
was emba
rrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United
States had promised that peace should be a joint affair a
greed to by
both nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to
some of their claims respecting boun
daries and fisheries, the American
commissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without
consulting the Fr
ench minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace
draft before they informed him of their operations. When Verg
ennes
reproached him, Franklin replied that they "had been guilty of
neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped
 that the great work
would not be ruined by a single indiscretion."

=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settle
ment at Paris in 1783
was a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the
United States, naming eac
h state specifically, and agreed to boundaries
extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lake
s
to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies
intact, made gains in India, and maintained
 her supremacy on the seas.
Spain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France
gained nothing import
ant save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled
and the colonies independent.

The generous terms secured by the 
American commission at Paris called
forth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way
for a rene
wal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the
same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats
. "This federal
republic is born a pigmy," wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal
master. "A day will come when it
 will be a giant; even a colossus
formidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility
for establish
ing a new population on immense lands, as well as the
advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and
 artisans
from all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the
tyrannical existence of the same colossu
s."

SUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD

The indepen
dence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European
statesmen as they watched the growth of their population
, wealth, and
power; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the
American colonists lived fairly
 happily under British dominion. There
were collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed
with sti
ff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the
exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases.
 Nevertheless, on
the whole, the relations between America and the mother country were
more amicable in 1763 than at 
any period under the Stuart regime which
closed in 1688.

The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any
 one. It was
the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.
Three years before, there had co
me to the throne George III, a young,
proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his
predecessor
s, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed
things to drift in England and America. George III deci
ded that he would
be king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought
to a close the long and cos
tly French and Indian War and was staggering
under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly
i
n defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
to English statesmen than the idea that the col
onies should bear part of
the cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into
prominence, in royal counci
ls, two men bent on taxing America and
controlling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,
the Engl
ish taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and
statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England 
therefore set
out upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated
their trade and set royal office
rs upon them to enforce the law. This
action evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act
Congress to de
clare their rights and petition for a redress of
grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,

sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.

Frightened by uprising, the English govern
ment drew back and repealed
the Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of
interference. Interference 
again called forth American protests.
Protests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent
over to k
eep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.
Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Bo
ston and
seized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.
The response of the colonists was a C
ontinental Congress for defense. An
unexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the
spring of
 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:
"The Americans are rebels!"

The die was cast. The Ameri
can Revolution had begun. Washington was made
commander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
volu
me of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.
Franklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1
778 he induced
France to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,
Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 
1783, by the formal treaty of
peace, George III acknowledged the independence of the United States.
The new nation, e
ndowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among th
e
sovereign powers of the earth.

In the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were
equally remar
kable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven
from the former dominions. All power was declared to be in th
e people.
All the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan
of government. The thirteen states w
ere united in common bonds under the
Articles of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.
Thus ther
e was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
world had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined 
to break down
and be supplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole continents hung upon
the answer.

PART III. THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS




CHAPTER VII

THE
 FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION


THE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA

The rise of a young republic composed o
f thirteen states, each governed
by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by "the plain
people," wa
s the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. The
majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices ha
d made this
possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those
Americans, however, who peered be
neath the surface of things, saw that
the Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
constitu
tions, drawn by finest enthusiasm "uninstructed by experience,"
could not alone make the republic great and prosperou
s or even free. All
around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
immediate future.

=The 
Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under
the Articles of Confederation had neither the stren
gth nor the resources
necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.
The sole organ of govern
ment was a Congress composed of from two to
seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and

paid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one
vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as V
irginia. There was no
president to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a
committee of thirteen--one 
from each state--to act as an executive body
when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved

a failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and
states could appeal for the protection of the
ir rights or through which
they could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,
military and finan
cial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could
authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payme
nt
of contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the
establishment of an army, but it could only request th
e states to supply
their respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring
any pressure to bear upon a 
single citizen in the whole country. It
could act only through the medium of the state governments.

=Financial and C
ommercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,
the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during t
he war was
still outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
principal. Public creditors were 
in despair, as the market value of
their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The
current bills
 of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was
not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with 
which to record
the transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter
chaos. Millions of dollars in n
otes issued by Congress had become mere
trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression
of con
tempt so forceful as the popular saying: "not worth a
Continental." To make matters worse, several of the states were
 pouring
new streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in
circulation consisted of English, F
rench, and Spanish coins, and the
public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
clipping and fil
ing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The
entire British system of trade discrimination was turned agai
nst the
Americans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,
was unable to retaliate or to negotiat
e treaties which it could enforce.
Domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which
erected tarif
f barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the
currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely diff
icult, and,
as if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering
the prompt collection of debts wi
thin their borders--an evil which
nothing but a national system of courts could cure.

=Congress in Disrepute.=--With
 treaties set at naught by the states, the
laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the
Congr
ess of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon
the states to pay their quotas of money into the t
reasury, only to be
treated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
futility. Some of the able
st men refused to accept election to it, and
many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
Agai
n and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
of business.

=Troubles of the State Governments
.=--The state governments, free to
pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as
many diff
iculties as the Congress. They too were loaded with
revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already resti
ve
population. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
fall in prices which followed the return o
f peace, the farmers of
several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
legislatures to issue large s
ums of paper money. The currency fell in
value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
old a
ccounts.

In every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.
Laws were made one year only to be re
pealed the next and reenacted the
third year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
canceled by its s
uccessor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural
consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would f
orbid
states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in
payment of debts, or to impair the obligat
ion of contracts. Men heavily
in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against
creditors.

So great
 did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in
1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a
 repeal of the
taxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an
armed rebellion was avoided. In 
Massachusetts the malcontents, under the
leadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,
organized t
hat same year open resistance to the government of the state.
Shays and his followers protested against the conduct o
f creditors in
foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the
lawyers for increasing the costs of 
legal proceedings, against the
senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
towns on the basis
 of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and
against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. T
hey seized
the towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of
justice. All through the western part of
 the state the revolt spread,
sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
republic. Only by the
 most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to
quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state

government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had
so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and
 several members of the
legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
were defeated at the
 ensuing election. The need of national assistance
for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere

emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.

=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American c
itizens,
watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that
the new ship of state so proudly la
unched a few years before was
careening into anarchy. "The facts of our peace and independence," wrote
a friend of Wa
shington, "do not at present wear so promising an
appearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,
jeal
ousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
confidence in our political establishments; and almos
t occasion me to
think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
which we have contended."

Wash
ington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's
rebellion, he exclaimed: "What, gracious God, is man
 that there should
be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the
other day that we were shed
ding our blood to obtain the constitutions
under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
n
ow we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them." The same year he
burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring ro
yal government. "I am
told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
without horror. From th
inking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is
often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a
tri
umph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for
the advocates of despotism to find that we are i
ncapable of governing
ourselves!"

ADVENTURE  I.  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

I.



To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes sh
e eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. A
ll emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I ta
ke it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed 
himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable
 things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
 to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
 which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own 
high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but 
one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of 
Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred inter
ests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb 
all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgi
ngs in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the 
drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the 
study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clu
es, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I 
heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing u
p of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplish
ed so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, wh
ich I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One ni
ght--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to c
ivil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be a
ssociated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen de
sire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, 
and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was paci
ng the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his
 every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his dr
ug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber whi
ch had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me
. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and 
indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singula
r introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half p
ounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fa
ncy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then, how
 do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that y
ou have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly h
ave been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in
 a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorri
gible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."

He chuckled to himsel
f and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the insi
de of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obvious
ly they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove cr
usted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a part
icularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my roo
ms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right s
ide of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him t
o be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his 
process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridic
ulously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled un
til you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lightin
g a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear
. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How oft
en?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not
 observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have b
oth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough t
o chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pi
nk-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."


The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to e
ight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent
 services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters whi
ch are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be i
n your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery,"
 I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before on
e has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note it
self. What do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.

"The 
man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such pape
r could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"Peculiar--that is the very w
ord," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with 
a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?
" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't'
 stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of c
ourse, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown
 volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not f
ar from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories an
d paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant 
cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a 
German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters receive
d.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only 
remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a ma
sk to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was t
he sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whi
stled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and
 a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else
."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. An
d this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want 
your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."

A slow
 and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then t
here was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than s
ix feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would,
 in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts
 of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colo
ured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfw
ay up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulen
ce which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the 
upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted tha
t very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a
 man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the
 length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I to
ld you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a sea
t," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases
. Whom have I the honour to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand 
that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extre
me importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by th
e wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything
 which you may say to me."

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you bot
h to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is no
t too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holme
s.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes hi
s agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exac
tly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
 has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning fami
lies of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."

"
I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor 
glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him 
as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatien
tly at his gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better 
able to advise you."

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then,
 with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cri
ed; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoke
n before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, 
and hereditary King of Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and pass
ing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my 
own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his powe
r. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting
 his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the
 acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up
 in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing 
all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could no
t at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and th
at of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born 
in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired fro
m operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young per
son, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how
--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow you
r Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove th
eir authenticity?"

"There is the writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own sea
l."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your M
ajesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised yourself seriously."

"I w
as only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We have tried and failed."


"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Tw
ice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been wayla
id. There has been no result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little pr
oblem," said he.

"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. And what does she 
propose to do with the photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I have heard."

"To 
Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of
 her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to
 an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it
. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of 
the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--n
one."

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would s
end it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three day
s yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into jus
t at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at the Lan
gham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray 
do so. I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I w
ould give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The King took a 
heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold and
 seven hundred in notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.

"
And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of
 it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and 
I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal
 brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should l
ike to chat this little matter over with you."

II.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes ha
d not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I
 sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deepl
y interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associ
ated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his 
client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand
, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasur
e to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextr
icable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased t
o enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side
-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's 
amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a 
nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting 
his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"W
ell, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in 
the chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what 
I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Mis
s Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little af
ter eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry
 among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bi
jou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the doo
r. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterou
s English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage windo
w could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of vie
w, but without noting anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that ther
e was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their hor
ses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information 
as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was no
t in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.


"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.
 So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and return
s at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a 
good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. G
odfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen t
imes from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up an
d down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an imp
ortant factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the 
object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably trans
ferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended wheth
er I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was 
a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to le
t you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.


"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out
. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeare
d to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air o
f a man who was thoroughly at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in th
e windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing
. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch f
rom his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent S
treet, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Aw
ay they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat littl
e landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness
 were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caugh
t a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

" 'The Church of
 St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to
 lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a c
ab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'T
he Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minute
s to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drov
e faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the
 door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had 
followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot 
in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to m
y surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.


" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

" 'What then?' I asked.

" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes,
 or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling r
esponses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in 
the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there w
as the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It
 was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that starte
d me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolut
ely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from havi
ng to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my 
watch chain in memory of the occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"

"Well
, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessi
tate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to t
he Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I he
ard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."

"Which are?"

"So
me cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am li
kely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."


"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"
Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish
?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the
 simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly f
ive now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at sev
en. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged w
hat is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understan
d?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in
 it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will op
en. You are to station yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to y
ou."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the 
same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, takin
g a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either en
d to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by qu
ite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that
 I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to thro
w in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then y
ou may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role
 I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and s
imple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, 
and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not
 merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh pa
rt that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist 
in crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we f
ound ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and do
wn in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it fro
m Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrar
y, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men
 smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-gi
rl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarke
d Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph beco
mes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, a
s our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"


"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy c
oncealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts
 of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"Where, then?
"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are natural
ly secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust he
r own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a busin
ess man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands 
upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"B
ut how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She 
will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."

As
 he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau 
which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to
 open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the sa
me intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the lo
ungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant th
e lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck 
savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he
 reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the g
uardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people,
 who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.
 Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure out
lined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"
He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can
 get him to hospital."

"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it ha
dn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May
 we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"


Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the pro
ceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see H
olmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he w
as playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful cre
ature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet 
it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened 
my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but p
reventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in nee
d of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the sig
nal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crow
d of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" T
hick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a
 moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting 
crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and
 to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down
 one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Noth
ing could have been better. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you fi
nd out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," sa
id he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.
 They were all engaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist r
ed paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous specta
cle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What e
lse could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her b
edroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open t
he window, and you had your chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her h
ouse is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering i
mpulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of
 use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches fo
r her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than wh
at we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were
 enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel jus
t above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When 
I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not s
een her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the p
hotograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A littl
e over-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the Ki
ng to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady,
 but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his
 Majesty to regain it with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, 
so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her 
life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He
 was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were 
several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had 
hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the d
euce that could have been."

III.


I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee
 in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock
 Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"T
hen, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will si
mplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.


"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."


"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoya
nce. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no re
ason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own
 station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up 
in Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us w
ith a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," 
answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that
 you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Contine
nt."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England
?"

"Never to return."

"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past the
 servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in ever
y direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
 Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograp
h and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock 
Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at 
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You
 took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betray
ed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an 
agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you
 wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. Bu
t, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of t
he freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I c
all them, and came down just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really
 an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and 
started for the Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidab
le an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest
 in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom 
he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from
 any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear
 Mr. Sherlock Holmes,


"Very truly yours,              
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!
" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she 
was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have s
een of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry
 that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my d
ear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now
 as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray
 tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out 
upon the palm of his hand.

"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.

"You ha
ve but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certa
inly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to w
ish you a very good morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out
 to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdo
m of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over 
the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers
 to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE


I 
had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation
 with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was abou
t to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"You could not possibly ha
ve come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very 
much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and help
er in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."


The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from 
his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips 
together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bi
zarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enth
usiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my
 own little adventures."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will rememb
er that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland,
 that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring t
han any effort of the imagination."

"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but non
e the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reas
on breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call up
on me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to f
or some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with th
e larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive cr
ime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instanc
e of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhap
s, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend
 Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have
 every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I
 am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I 
am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest wit
h an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoa
t. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his kne
e, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which mi
ght be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore e
very mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shep
herd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy 
brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded bro
wn overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing
 remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his fe
atures.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questi
oning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is
 a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce n
othing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my com
panion.

"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for exam
ple, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir.
 Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."


"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, es
pecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."

"Ah, of course, I
 forgot that. But the writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and th
e left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that
 you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study o
f tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales 
of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain,
 the matter becomes even more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at fir
st that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I begin to think, Watson,
" said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reput
ation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes
, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is wha
t began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RED-HEA
DED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now a
nother vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All r
ed-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on 
Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on ear
th does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wri
ggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. 
"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this
 advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Mo
rning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I have 
been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's busines
s at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just giv
e me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him b
ut that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?
" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age
. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice
 what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? 
You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience amo
ng employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has 
his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ough
t to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures.
 That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I pres
ume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I
 have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we k
eep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that advert
isement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he 
says:

" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.

" 'Why,' says he, 'he
re's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, a
nd I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to
 do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

"
 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me i
nstead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I di
dn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'Have you never heard of the 
League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligib
le yourself for one of the vacancies.'

" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a ye
ar, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

"Well, you can easily
 think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra coupl
e of hundred would have been very handy.

" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advert
isement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for
 particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was v
ery peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he 
died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the int
erest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and ver
y little to do.'

" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

" 'Not so many as yo
u might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started
 from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use 
your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you ca
red to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out
 of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, tha
t my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the mat
ter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I
 thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with 
me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given 
us in the advertisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and w
est every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street 
was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought the
re were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour the
y were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had t
he real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spauldi
ng would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me throu
gh the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going
 up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the offi
ce."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memo
ry with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but
 a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.
 He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which wou
ld disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn c
ame the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so
 that he might have a private word with us.

" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to f
ill a vacancy in the League.'

" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. 
I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed a
t my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on
 my success.

" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an 
obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There i
s water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful,
 for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgu
st you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vaca
ncy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions u
ntil there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan
 Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. W
ilson? Have you a family?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, '
that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread
 of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"M
y face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking
 it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection m
ight be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be ab
le to enter upon your new duties?'

" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.

" 'Oh, 
never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'

" 'What w
ould be the hours?' I asked.

" 'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,
 especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little
 in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.


" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

" 'Is $4 a week.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is purely nomina
l.'

" 'What do you call purely nominal?'

" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the wh
ole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't co
mply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'

" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should
 not think of leaving,' said I.

" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor a
nything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but 
we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Ja
bez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to g
ain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleas
ed at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for 
I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be 
I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such
 a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could 
to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to 
have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper
, I started off for Pope's Court.

"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table 
was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the 
letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clo
ck he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after m
e.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden soverei
gns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and
 every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after 
a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not su
re when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of i
t.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and At
tica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and
 I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"To an e
nd?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and
 locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you ca
n read for yourself."

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this
 fashion:


THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSOLVED.

October 9, 1890.


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announ
cement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consi
deration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
 client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsew
here."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss
 your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something j
ust a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"

"I was staggered, 
sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it
. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell 
me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who M
r. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

" 'What, 
the red-headed man?'

" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my ro
om as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

" 'Where could I find him?
'

" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started o
ff, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had eve
r heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to
 Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say th
at if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a p
lace without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of
 it, I came right away to you."

"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one,
 and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang
 from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a we
ek."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against th
is extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute 
knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."

"No
, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it wa
s a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."

"We shall ende
avour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who fir
st called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he co
me?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"


"Because he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaul
ding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a whit
e splash of acid upon his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," sai
d he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done i
t for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"

"Oh, yes, s
ir; I have only just left him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, 
sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion
 upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a concl
usion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of 
it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is 
the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a 
commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"What are you going to d
o, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me 
for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there 
he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to t
he conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair wit
h the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at the S
t. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hou
rs?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going
 through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music o
n the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspe
ct. Come along!"

We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Squar
e, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel pla
ce, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of w
eedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place w
here our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side 
and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, an
d then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, ha
ving thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It w
as instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holm
es, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered the as
sistant promptly, closing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment,
 the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known so
mething of him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the R
ed-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What th
en?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavemen
t?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know somet
hing of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves 
as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of
 a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and 
west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while 
the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
 of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant s
quare which we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I s
hould like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.
 There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, th
e Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And no
w, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin
-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conu
ndrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of n
o ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his lon
g, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those
 of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to c
onceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuten
ess represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally p
redominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, h
e was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisation
s and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his br
illiant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods woul
d look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enw
rapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself t
o hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And 
I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"
A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-
day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early
 enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so 
kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant a
mong the crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my o
wn stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, an
d yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, whil
e to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over
 it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg 
Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I 
go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's
 assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despai
r and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from h
ome and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the d
oor, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in ani
mated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other 
was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is co
mplete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think y
ou know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night
's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend h
ere is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."

"I hope
 a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place consider
able confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he 
won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. I
t is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has b
een more nearly correct than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger
 with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years t
hat I have not had my rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake
 to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake 
will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the 
murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, an
d I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. 
His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers,
 and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Sc
otland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years an
d have never set eyes on him yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or
 two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past 
ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the 
second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes 
which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into
 Farrington Street.

"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and 
personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though 
an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a
 lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowde
d thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance o
f Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was
 a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding st
one steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conduct
ed us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was
 piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held
 up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags whic
h lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask y
ou to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solem
n Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon
 his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between t
he stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.

"
We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is sa
fely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for t
heir escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the 
principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reas
ons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"It is o
ur French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your
 French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,00
0 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and tha
t it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead 
foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the direct
ors have had misgivings upon the subject."

"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time th
at we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryw
eather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pac
k of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I 
see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we
 must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us som
e harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when
 I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."

I
 placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across th
e front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. T
he smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. 
To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden g
loom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through th
e house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two of
ficers waiting at the front door."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."

What a
 time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the nig
ht must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my
 position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not
 only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky 
Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction 
of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavemen
t. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to ope
n and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For 
a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly a
s it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disap
pearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon 
its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a 
clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itse
lf shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the 
hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red ha
ir.

"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swi
ng for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and
 I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver,
 but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"It's no use, J
ohn Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness
. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him
 at the door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."

"
And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently
," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."

"I beg that y
ou will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You 
may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir
' and 'please.' "

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, 
where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He 
made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes,"
 said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. T
here is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts 
at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle 
with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank 
to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing
 the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the 
morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the 
only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Enc
yclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a c
urious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested 
to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and wh
at was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office,
 the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
 week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some 
strong motive for securing the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been women in 
the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business
 was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an
 expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assist
ant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tan
gled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest
 and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for
 months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other
 building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement
 with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I r
ang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon
 each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked
 how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what
 they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises,
 and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon th
e chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make 
their attempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no lo
nger about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential th
at they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them bett
er than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come
 to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet 
every link rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me.
 My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to d
o so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is 
of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sa
nd."

ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY


"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fi
re in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We
 would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that w
indow hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are go
ing on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through 
generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen
 conclusions most stale and unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to 
light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to i
ts extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain select
ion and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police rep
ort, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an obs
erver contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace
."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of un
official adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in c
ontact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it
 to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a
 column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the oth
er woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could
 invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the
 paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in cleari
ng up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduc
t complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hur
ling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average stor
y-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."

He held out h
is snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his ho
mely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you
 for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Iren
e Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.

"It wa
s from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot co
nfide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"And have you any on
 hand just now?" I asked with interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They ar
e important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matter
s that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to 
an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, 
is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, th
ere is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better bef
ore very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair a
nd was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his sh
oulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a larg
e curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her 
ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body osci
llated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swim
mer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

"I have seen those s
ymptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an af
faire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet
 even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the us
ual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so muc
h angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke there was a tap a
t the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his
 small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the e
asy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her o
ver in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your 
short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where 
the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start an
d looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she 
cried, "else how could you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. P
erhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you
, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had gi
ven him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a y
ear in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become o
f Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-t
ips together and his eyes to the ceiling.

Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sut
herland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windiba
nk--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
 would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and ca
me right away to you."

"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."

"Yes, my
 stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myse
lf."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she ma
rried again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a p
lumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, t
he foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in
 wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had be
en alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, o
n the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "d
oes it come out of the business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It
 is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touc
h the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, w
ith what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a 
single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, b
ut you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the
 money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest 
every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It br
ings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position v
ery clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. 
Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and 
she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to 
send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank
 did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a 
Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the 
folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to w
ear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would
 do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be o
ur foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back f
rom France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I
 remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her 
way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, si
r. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that i
s to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could no
t come to the house any more."

"No?"

"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any 
visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as 
I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr.
 Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer
 wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the mean
time, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."


"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that 
we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What office?"

"That's the wors
t of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his
 address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenh
all Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed 
by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wou
ldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he al
ways felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the li
ttle things that he would think of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that 
the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?
"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said 
that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy
 and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whisperi
ng fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and 
he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to
 France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He wa
s in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be tru
e to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in h
is favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I
 began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mothe
r said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask 
his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to fathe
r at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the we
dding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unf
ortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It 
was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hos
mer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheel
er, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drov
e up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was 
no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his o
wn eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon
 what became of him."

"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He wa
s too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be tru
e; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged t
o him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has
 happened since gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen cat
astrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so
. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."


"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the
 matter again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happ
ened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors
 of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settl
ed on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling
 of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, an
d I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.


"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite 
result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try
 to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him
 again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like a
n accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's 
Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31
 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business
?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made 
your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the 
whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I can
not do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the preposterous hat and
 the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid
 her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summ
oned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched ou
t in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay
 pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-w
reaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," 
he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You wil
l find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague l
ast year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was
 most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not i
nvisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never
 bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang
 from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-colou
red, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, 
and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purp
le plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I 
didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar,
 comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

" 'Pon my word, Wats
on, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everythi
ng of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impre
ssions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is 
perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is
 a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses a
gainst the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on t
he left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this 
was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a rema
rk upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious
. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing w
ere not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a pl
ain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. No
w, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, i
t is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I alw
ays was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home bu
t after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently
 see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep.
 It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rath
er elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Ho
smer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a 
gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a li
ttle bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dr
essed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed
 trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street
. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are 
very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable p
oint, however, which will no doubt strike you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but the signatu
re is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscript
ion except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we ma
y call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the cas
e?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach o
f promise were instituted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the
 matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether
 he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male 
relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little probl
em upon the shelf for the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning a
nd extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour
 with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fai
l, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business
 of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would b
e a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with th
e conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which wo
uld lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professional case of great gra
vity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. 
It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Ba
ker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock 
Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable 
array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his d
ay in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was th
e bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working 
upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. Th
e only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his 
object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lip
s to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr.
 James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"

The man who ent
ered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, ins
inuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of u
s, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.

"Good-even
ing, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appoi
ntment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, y
ou know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not 
to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impul
sive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of cou
rse, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a 
family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hos
mer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discoveri
ng Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he sai
d.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's ha
ndwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and
 some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some l
ittle slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics,
 but those are the more obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is 
a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show yo
u what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monog
raph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some lit
tle attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each
 case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying 
lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out o
f his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If y
ou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and
 turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, 
turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holm
es suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very ba
d compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and le
t us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "
It--it's not actionable," he stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it 
was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the c
ourse of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk 
upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, lean
ing back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"The man married
 a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter a
s long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
 made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, b
ut affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her 
little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a 
hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and 
forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. Sh
e became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. 
What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the
 connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the 
face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly sec
ure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love h
imself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried a
way."

"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made 
up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She 
was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her m
other. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a r
eal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affecti
ons from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to Fra
nce were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that 
it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor f
or some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possib
ility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so boun
d to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to 
another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished 
away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain o
f events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he
 rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "
but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and no
t me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open t
o an action for assault and illegal constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and
 throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or 
a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitte
r sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think 
I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild cl
atter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank runn
ing at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw hi
mself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and
 ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely se
e all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer 
Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really pro
fited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together
, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the cur
ious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his pecul
iar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that 
she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, 
all pointed in the same direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get 
corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everythi
ng from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, 
with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had alr
eady noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him i
f he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defec
ts. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tall
ied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell he
r she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub
, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as m
uch knowledge of the world."

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY


We were seated at breakfast one morning, my
 wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:

"Have you a coupl
e of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Sha
ll be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."

"What do you say, dear
?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
 present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the 
change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful i
f I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I h
ave only half an hour."

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt 
and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise
, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure ma
de even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of
 you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoro
ughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get t
he tickets."

We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him
. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then
 he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you heard anything of the 
case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."

"The London press has not had very full accou
nts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I
 gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"Bu
t it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, th
e more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the
 son of the murdered man."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for gran
ted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as 
I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ros
s, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia
 and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Ch
arles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnat
ural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the r
icher man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were f
requently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but nei
ther of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to ha
ve led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of t
he neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen 
at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.

"On June 3rd, tha
t is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscom
be Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had 
been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appoin
tment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.

"From Hatherley Farmhouse to t
he Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, 
whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these
 witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing M
r. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of
 his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the m
atter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

"The two McCarthys were seen after the time wh
en William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fring
e of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper o
f the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, a
t the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a viole
nt quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up h
is hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother whe
n she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that t
hey were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say th
at he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, withou
t either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following
 him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated b
lows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of
 his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the youn
g man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was
 on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the m
ain facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damn
ing case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."

"Circumstantial evid
ence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if 
you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something 
entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and i
t is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among t
hem Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lest
rade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade,
 being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westwar
d at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the fa
cts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive
 than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may
 have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I sh
all either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding.
 To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand si
de, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"


"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, an
d in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back o
n the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear t
hat that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an e
qual light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inferenc
e. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies bef
ore us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"
What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On t
he inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, 
and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of do
ubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it
 was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at leas
t a most suspicious remark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in
 the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumsta
nces were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should
 have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstance
s, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as e
ither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deser
ts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no 
doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to t
he little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contritio
n which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."

I s
hook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.

"So they have. And many men have bee
n wrongfully hanged."

"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouragin
g to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may re
ad it for yourself."

He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down t
he sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occu
rred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:

"Mr. James
 McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for
 three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent fro
m home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the 
groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him g
et out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun a
nd strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon
 the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistak
en in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards f
rom the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward,
 and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I
 was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a ver
y violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. 
I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back aga
in. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my a
rms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge
-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have 
no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but
 he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Coroner: Did your father m
ake any statement to you before he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a
 rat.

"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was 
delirious.

"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?

"Witness: I shou
ld prefer not to answer.

"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me t
o tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

"The Coroner: That is fo
r the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably 
in any future proceedings which may arise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Coroner: I understand that the cry o
f 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?

"Witness: It was.

"The Coroner: How was it, then, that h
e uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"Witness (with considera
ble confusion): I do not know.

"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on he
aring the cry and found your father fatally injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Coroner: What do you mean?

"
Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my fat
her. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed t
o me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked rou
nd for it, but it was gone.

" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" 'Yes, it was gone.'

" 
'You cannot say what it was?'

" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

" 'How far from the body?'

" 'A dozen y
ards or so.'

" 'And how far from the edge of the wood?'

" 'About the same.'

" 'Then if it was removed it was while
 you were within a dozen yards of it?'

" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded the examination of the
 witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather seve
re upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to 
him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular acco
unt of his father's dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."

Holmes laughed softly to h
imself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he
, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him cre
dit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
 give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a d
ying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point 
of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is
 my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at S
windon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passi
ng through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little coun
try-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of
 the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no diffic
ulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been 
engaged for us.

"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic natur
e, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very nice and complimentar
y of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not 
quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful
 of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I 
do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, n
o doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the
 more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive on
e, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which 
you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."

He had hardly spok
en before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet 
eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpower
ing excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally,
 with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to
 tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Neve
r let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults a
s no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows hi
m."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."

"But
 you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not you
rself think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her he
ad and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid t
hat my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he 
is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak
 about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to 
hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should 
be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young a
nd has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there
 were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."

"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a 
union?"

"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her f
resh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this information," said h
e. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The doctor?"

"Yes, have 
you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has take
n to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the 
only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."

"Yes, at the m
ines."

"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."

"Yes, certainly."

"Thank 
you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."

"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No 
doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."


"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and
 God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the whe
els of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a fe
w minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, 
but I call it cruel."

"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see
 him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have st
ill time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you wi
ll find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."

I walked down to the station with them, and then 
wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried 
to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the de
ep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact,
 that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Sup
posing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen 
and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, 
drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might no
t the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly coun
ty paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the poste
rior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from 
a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was t
o some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did n
ot go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth whil
e to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It cou
ld not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be a
n attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible exp
lanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dr
opped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and t
o carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of
 mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much fai
th in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his convic
tion of young McCarthy's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade wa
s staying in lodgings in the town.

"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importan
ce that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very b
est and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen yo
ung McCarthy."

"And what did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was incli
ned to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is
 as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, soun
d at heart."

"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with 
so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."

"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insan
ely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had bee
n away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and 
marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to hi
m to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible
. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last inte
rview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and hi
s father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was 
with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mar
k that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that 
he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she 
has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of 
news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."

"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"

"Ah! who?
 I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with so
meone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when h
e would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returne
d. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please
, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning 
broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Fa
rm and the Boscombe Pool.

"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of t
he Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his 
constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business ha
s had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for 
I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."

"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In
 a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."

"Really! Does it not s
trike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under 
such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress t
o the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would f
ollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much
. Do you not deduce something from that?"

"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said Lestrade, winking
 at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."

"You are ri
ght," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."

"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which y
ou seem to find it difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.

"And that is--"

"That McCarthy sen
ior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."

"Well, moons
hine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm
 upon the left."

"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, wi
th great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it
 a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, 
at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's,
 though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points
, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool
.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinke
r and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were draw
n into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent down
ward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His n
ostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon th
e matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, im
patient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by
 way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of 
many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry 
on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, th
e detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the convictio
n that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt 
sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park o
f the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacle
s which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick
, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which l
ined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the grou
nd, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could se
e by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, l
ike a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.

"What did you go into the pool for?" he aske
d.

"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--"

"Oh, tut, 
tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and 
there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd
 of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all t
racks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens 
and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are
 young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the he
els hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father's
 feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this
? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again-
-of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes fin
ding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree
 in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a 
little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up
 what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of t
he tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and re
tained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.

"It h
as been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house
 on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little not
e. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."


It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the sto
ne which he had picked up in the wood.

"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder w
as done with it."

"I see no marks."

"There are none."

"How do you know, then?"

"The grass was growing under it. I
t had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the inju
ries. There is no sign of any other weapon."

"And the murderer?"

"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right 
leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blun
t pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."

Le
strade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal wi
th a hard-headed British jury."

"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work 
mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."

"And leave your cas
e unfinished?"

"No, finished."

"But the mystery?"

"It is solved."

"Who was the criminal, then?"

"The gentleman I
 describe."

"But who is he?"

"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourho
od."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to go about th
e country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."


"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a
 line before I leave."

Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table
. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perpl
exing position.

"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me prea
ch to you for a little. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expou
nd."

"Pray do so."

"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which
 struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his fa
ther should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to 
a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double poi
nt our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."

"What o
f this 'Cooee!' then?"

"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in
 Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever i
t was that he had the appointment with. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Aus
tralians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someo
ne who had been in Australia."

"What of the rat, then?"

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and fla
ttened it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night
." He put his hand over part of the map. "What do you read?"

"ARAT," I read.

"And now?" He raised his hand.

"BALLA
RAT."

"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was 
trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."

"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.

"It is obvious. 
And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point whic
h, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definit
e conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."

"Certainly."

"And one who was at home in the distri
ct, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."

"Quite s
o."

"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave
 to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."

"But how did you gain them?"

"You know my metho
d. It is founded upon the observation of trifles."

"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length o
f his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."

"Yes, they were peculiar boots."

"But his lameness?
"

"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because
 he limped--he was lame."

"But his left-handedness."

"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recor
ded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, 
how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the f
ather and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enab
les me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little mon
ograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then lo
oked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety whi
ch are rolled in Rotterdam."

"And the cigar-holder?"

"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore
 he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pe
n-knife."

"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an 
innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this 
points. The culprit is--"

"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and usher
ing in a visitor.

The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulder
s gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed th
at he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, 
drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white,
 while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
 he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.

"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my
 note?"

"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."

"I thought
 people would talk if I went to the Hall."

"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with d
espair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather
 than the words. "It is so. I know all about McCarthy."

The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cr
ied. "But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went
 against him at the Assizes."

"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would have spoken now had it 
not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."

"It
 may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who re
quired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."

"I am a dying m
an," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Y
et I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."

Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his h
and and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign i
t, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy.
 I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."

"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a qu
estion whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. A
nd now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.


"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutche
s of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first 
how I came to be in his power.

"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and 
reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, to
ok to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had
 a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings
. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat G
ang.

"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There w
ere six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Th
ree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who wa
s this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked litt
le eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and mad
e our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a
 quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little
 good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young s
he left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as 
nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was goin
g well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.

"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Stre
et with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.

" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we
'll be as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don't
--it's a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman within hail.'

"Well, down they came to
 the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. The
re was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elb
ow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. What
ever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he a
sked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.

"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as
 I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. B
ut there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but hi
s blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to 
meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.

"When I went down there I found him talking with his son
, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was b
lack and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for 
what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held 
most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desper
ate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my gir
l! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as 
I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshe
s which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some fou
l and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go
 back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."


"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I 
pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."

"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"

"In view 
of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court tha
n the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shal
l never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."

"Farewell, the
n," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace w
hich you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.

"God h
elp us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of
 such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock 
Holmes.' "

James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been draw
n out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he
 is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of
 the black cloud which rests upon their past.

ADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS


When I glance over my notes and 
records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and i
nteresting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already
 gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my frien
d possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled hi
s analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially c
leared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof
 which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startli
ng in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connecti
on with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.

The year '87 furnished us with a 
long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twe
lve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a lu
xurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque 
Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwel
l poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, 
to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time
--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future
 date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken u
p my pen to describe.

It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional 
violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart o
f great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise
 the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like unta
med beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a chil
d in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while
 I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to
 blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on
 a visit to her mother's, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.

"Why," sa
id I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?
"

"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."

"A client, then?"

"If so, it is a ser
ious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely
 to be some crony of the landlady's."

Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in
 the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards 
the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

"Come in!" said he.

The man who entered was young, some two-and-tw
enty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The stre
aming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he
 had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eye
s heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apology," he said, raising h
is golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the stor
m and rain into your snug chamber."

"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook a
nd will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Horsham."

"That clay and chalk m
ixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."

"I have come for advice."

"That is easily got."

"And 
help."

"That is not always so easy."

"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved
 him in the Tankerville Club scandal."

"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."

"He said th
at you could solve anything."

"He said too much."

"That you are never beaten."

"I have been beaten four times--thr
ee times by men, and once by a woman."

"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"

"It is true t
hat I have been generally successful."

"Then you may be so with me."

"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the
 fire and favour me with some details as to your case."

"It is no ordinary one."

"None of those which come to me ar
e. I am the last court of appeal."

"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened
 to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family."

"You fill m
e with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question
 you as to those details which seem to me to be most important."

The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his we
t feet out towards the blaze.

"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can unders
tand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts,
 I must go back to the commencement of the affair.

"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias a
nd my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bic
ycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able t
o sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.

"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and
 became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jacks
on's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to
 his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a smal
l estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving t
hem was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He 
was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring dispositio
n. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or
 three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would neve
r leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not wa
nt any friends, not even his own brother.

"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when h
e saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine yea
rs in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober h
e used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the s
ervants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all
 the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was 
one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably lo
cked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through
 the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected 
in such a room.

"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the co
lonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and 
he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Open
ing it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laug
h at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protrudi
ng, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!
' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'

" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.

" 'Death,' sa
id he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope a
nd saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was noth
ing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, a
nd as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one
 hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.

" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them s
till,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Hor
sham lawyer.'

"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was bur
ning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stoo
d open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble
 K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.

" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I le
ave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doub
t, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and l
eave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are 
going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'

"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer t
ook it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered ov
er it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vag
ue feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happene
d to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and 
he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon 
the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about
 the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped
 up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at
 the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at
 the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it w
ere new raised from a basin.

"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, the
re came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went t
o search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sig
n of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, br
ought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persua
de myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possessi
on of the estate, and of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."

"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your 
statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the recept
ion by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."

"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His d
eath was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd."

"Thank you. Pray proceed."

"When my father took over the Ho
rsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found
 the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with th
e initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. These, w
e presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was n
othing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life
 in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of 
a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned wi
th politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down f
rom the North.

"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as po
ssible with us until the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of s
urprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and
 five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-an
d-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.


" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.

"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.


"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above the
m?'

" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.

" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.


" 'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'

" 'Poo
h!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kin
d. Where does the thing come from?'

" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.

" 'Some preposterous pra
ctical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.'

" 'I s
hould certainly speak to the police,' I said.

" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'

" 'Then let 
me do so?'

" 'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'

"It was in vain to argue with him, f
or he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.

"On the third day
 after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in com
mand of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther f
rom danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I receive
d a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which
 abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away w
ithout having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, a
nd as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict
 of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find
 anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no recor
d of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and th
at I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.

"In this sinister way I came into my inheri
tance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in 
some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in a
nother.

"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since 
then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from 
the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday 
morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father."

The young man took from his waistcoat 
a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.

"This is the envel
ope," he continued. "The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father's 
last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the sundial.' "

"What have you done?" asked Holmes.

"Nothing.
"

"Nothing?"

"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt l
ike one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, in
exorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against."

"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You mus
t act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."

"I have seen the police.
"

"Ah!"

"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that 
the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, a
nd were not to be connected with the warnings."

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!"
 he cried.

"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."

"Has he come with you
 to-night?"

"No. His orders were to stay in the house."

Again Holmes raved in the air.

"Why did you come to me," h
e cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"

"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major P
rendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you."

"It is really two days since you had the letter
. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before u
s--no suggestive detail which might help us?"

"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pock
et, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembran
ce," said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay 
amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am incline
d to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way 
has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a 
page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."

Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over t
he sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1
869," and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:

"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.

"7th. Set the pips 
on McCauley, Paramore, and

        John Swain, of St. Augustine.

"9th. McCauley cleared.

"10th. John Swain cleared
.

"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."

"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visito
r. "And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. 
You must get home instantly and act."

"What shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. Yo
u must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put
 in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. Y
ou must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box 
out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"

"Entirely."

"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sor
t, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is alrea
dy woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the
 mystery and to punish the guilty parties."

"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "
You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."

"Do not lose an instant. And, above all,
 take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a ve
ry real and imminent danger. How do you go back?"

"By train from Waterloo."

"It is not yet nine. The streets will b
e crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."

"I am armed."

"Tha
t is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."

"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"

"No, your secret lies
 in London. It is there that I shall seek it."

"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to
 the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Ou
tside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed
 to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have 
been reabsorbed by them once more.

Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his 
eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smok
e-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases 
we have had none more fantastic than this."

"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."

"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And
 yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos."

"But have you," I 
asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?"

"There can be no question as to their nature," 
he answered.

"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"

Sherlock Holme
s closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasone
r," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all t
he chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly 
describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link
 in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not y
et grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled a
ll those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it i
s necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in i
tself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education an
d encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all 
knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remembe
r rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."

"
Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I r
emember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chem
istry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsm
an, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."

Holmes g
rinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic s
tocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his librar
y, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we ne
ed certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia which stands
 upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the 
first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving Ame
rica. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida f
or the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he w
as in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something
 which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable let
ters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"

"The first w
as from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London."

"From East London. What do you deduce from 
that?"

"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."

"Excellent. We have already a clue. There c
an be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let u
s consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in D
undee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"

"A greater distance to travel."

"But the le
tter had also a greater distance to come."

"Then I do not see the point."

"There is at least a presumption that the
 vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or toke
n before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dund
ee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a 
matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat 
which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."

"It is possible."

"More than that. It is
 probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow h
as always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes fr
om London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persec
ution?"

"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing
-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried o
ut two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have be
en men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way y
ou see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society."

"But of what society
?"

"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku K
lux Klan?"

"I never have."

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently
:

" 'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terri
ble secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapi
dly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,
 and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the 
murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by 
a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some part
s, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or 
might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some s
trange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that the
re is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages 
were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the Unite
d States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the moveme
nt rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'

"You wi
ll observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
 disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder th
at he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register
 and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at ni
ght until it is recovered."

"Then the page we have seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right
, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that
 A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I
 think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw ha
s in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me 
over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of o
ur fellow men."

It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim vei
l which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.

"You will excuse me fo
r not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Ope
nshaw's."

"What steps will you take?" I asked.

"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I 
may have to go down to Horsham, after all."

"You will not go there first?"

"No, I shall commence with the City. Jus
t ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee."

As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table
 and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.

"Holmes," I cried, "you are to
o late."

"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see t
hat he was deeply moved.

"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here i
s the account:

" 'Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Br
idge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in 
spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, a
nd, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whos
e name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near 
Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and tha
t in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-place
s for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had bee
n the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to 
the condition of the riverside landing-stages.' "

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shak
en than I had ever seen him.

"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but i
t hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon thi
s gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair
 and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and
 unclasping of his long thin hands.

"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they have decoye
d him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, eve
n on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"


"To the police?"

"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before."


All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sher
lock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up t
o the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of
 water.

"You are hungry," I remarked.

"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast."

"N
othing?"

"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."

"And how have you succeeded?"

"Well."

"You have a clue?"

"I
 have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their ow
n devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"

"What do you mean?"

He took an orange from the cupboard, a
nd tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelo
pe. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun
, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia."

"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give 
him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."

"And who is this
 Captain Calhoun?"

"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."

"How did you trace it, then?"


He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.

"I have spent the whole day," said
 he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched a
t Pondicherry in January and February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there d
uring those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported a
s having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union."

"Texas, I think."


"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin."

"What then?"

"I searched
 the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a cert
ainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London."

"Yes?"

"The Lone Star had arr
ived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tid
e this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and a
s the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."

"
What will you do, then?"

"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Am
ericans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last
 night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Sav
annah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
 three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."

There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of 
human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that anot
her, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial g
ales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear t
hat somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, wit
h the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.

ADVENTU
RE  VI.  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP


Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theolo
gical College of St. George's, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolis
h freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenche
d his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the 
practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object
 of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, 
and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.

One night--it was in June, '89--the
re came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my ch
air, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.

"A patient!" said sh
e. "You'll have to go out."

I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard the door open, a few hu
rried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured s
tuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losin
g her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in s
uch trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney
. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in."

"I didn't know what to do, so I came 
straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.

"It w
as very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about 
it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's 
about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!"

It was not the first time that she had 
spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothe
d and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could
 bring him back to her?

It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was o
n him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one
 day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-fo
rty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effe
cts. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?
 How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruff
ians who surrounded him?

There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her t
o this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, and as 
such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send 
him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I h
ad left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as 
it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.

But there was no great diff
iculty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which l
ine the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a ste
ep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Or
dering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and
 by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick 
and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.

Thro
ugh the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees
, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer.
 Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison w
axed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talke
d together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off in
to silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther e
nd was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old ma
n, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.

As I entered, a sa
llow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

"Th
ank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with
 him."

There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, ha
ggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.

"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with 
every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"

"Nearly eleven."

"Of what day?"

"Of Friday, June 19
th."

"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank hi
s face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been w
aiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have
 only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't fright
en Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"

"Yes, I have one waiting."

"Then I shall go in it. B
ut I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."

I walked down t
he narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the
 drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my
 skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my 
ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, v
ery thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped 
in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent
 me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form h
ad filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grin
ning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantl
y, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"Hol
mes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ea
rs. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to h
ave a little talk with you."

"I have a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for 
he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your 
wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."


It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put 
forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission 
was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend
 in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written
 my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time
 a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two st
reets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself
 out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opiu
m-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical 
views."

"I was certainly surprised to find you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."

"I came to find a fri
end."

"And I to find an enemy."

"An enemy?"

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Bri
efly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent rambl
ings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
 hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to
 have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which co
uld tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"


"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that 
den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to l
eave it more. But our trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a sign
al which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink 
of horses' hoofs.

"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golde
n tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"

"If I can be of use."

"Oh, a tr
usty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."

"The C
edars?"

"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry."

"Where is it, then?"


"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."

"But I am all in the dark."

"Of course you are. You'll 
know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown. Look out for 
me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!"

He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed awa
y through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across
 a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness o
f bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts
 of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled diml
y here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and th
e air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which se
emed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several 
miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his sh
oulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.

"You ha
ve a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a gr
eat thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should
 say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."

"You forget that I know nothing about it."


"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, so
mehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end of it into my hand. N
ow, I'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."


"Proceed, then."

"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair b
y name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived gene
rally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local 
brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into 
town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seve
n years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular wi
th all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, 
amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, th
erefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.

"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into
 town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and th
at he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon t
his same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she 
had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in yo
ur London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane
, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to th
e company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to
 the station. Have you followed me so far?"

"It is very clear."

"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day
, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood
 in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation o
r cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a s
econd-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agita
ted. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that 
he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine e
ye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.


"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opiu
m den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led
 to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thr
ust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most 
maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of cons
tables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spit
e of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been
 seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippl
ed wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one els
e had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, a
nd had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box w
hich lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which
 he had promised to bring home.

"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspec
tor realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable 
crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the
 back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but
 is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened f
rom below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visib
le upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. N
eville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There
 were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out o
f the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the
 sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment 
of the tragedy.

"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was kn
own to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to have been at the foot o
f the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than 
an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to
 the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentl
eman's clothes.

"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the
 opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boo
ne, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar
, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance do
wn Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here 
it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a
 piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside h
im. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I hav
e been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that n
o one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, b
y its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark
 eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of me
ndicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at hi
m by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the
 last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."

"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-ha
nded against a man in the prime of life?"

"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other resp
ects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that w
eakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."

"Pray continue your narrative."


"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the po
lice, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the ca
se, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matt
er. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he mi
ght have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, w
ithout anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shi
rt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came 
from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there 
came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the 
presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion t
hat she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He w
as removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that
 the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.

"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had
 feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded.
 And what do you think they found in the pockets?"

"I cannot imagine."

"No, I don't think you would guess. Every po
cket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been s
wept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house
. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the ri
ver."

"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone
?"

"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair 
through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course i
nstantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act 
of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard 
the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar conf
ederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoar
d, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands in
to the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garm
ents had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."


"It certainly sounds feasible."

"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I ha
ve told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anythin
g against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet 
and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Cla
ir was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with h
is disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experienc
e which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."

While Sherlock Holmes had b
een detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the 
last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just a
s he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.


"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, s
tarting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is Th
e Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of
 our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Because there are many i
nquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest a
ssured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have 
no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood with
in its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small,
 winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood i
n the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wri
sts. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her ea
gerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.


"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan
 as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"None."

"No bad?"

"No."


"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day."

"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. 
He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring h
im out and associate him with this investigation."

"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "
You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has c
ome so suddenly upon us."

"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see th
at no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy."


"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supp
er had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will gi
ve a plain answer."

"Certainly, madam."

"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainti
ng. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."

"Upon what point?"

"In your heart of hearts, do you think that 
Neville is alive?"

Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing 
upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."


"You think that he is dead?"

"I do."

"Murdered?"

"I don't say that. Perhaps."

"And on what day did he meet his de
ath?"

"On Monday."

"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a l
etter from him to-day."

Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.

"What!" he roared.

"
Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.

"May I see it?"

"Certainly."

He sna
tched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intentl
y. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped wit
h the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably aft
er midnight.

"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."

"No, but the en
closure is."

"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address."

"How ca
n you tell that?"

"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish 
colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none wo
uld be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the addr
ess, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so import
ant as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"

"Yes, there was a ring. His signet
-ring."

"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"

"One of his hands."

"One?"

"His hand when he wrote h
urriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well."

" 'Dearest do not be frightened. All will co
me well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in
 pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirt
y thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. 
And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words."

"And they were pos
ted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger
 is over."

"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The r
ing, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"

"Ver
y well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day."

"That is possible."

"If so, much may 
have happened between."

"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so k
een a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himsel
f in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had
 happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"

"I have seen too mu
ch not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And
 in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is a
live and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"

"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."

"And on
 Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"

"No."

"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"

"Very m
uch so."

"Was the window open?"

"Yes."

"Then he might have called to you?"

"He might."

"He only, as I understand
, gave an inarticulate cry?"

"Yes."

"A call for help, you thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hands."

"But it might have
 been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"

"It is 
possible."

"And you thought he was pulled back?"

"He disappeared so suddenly."

"He might have leaped back. You did
 not see anyone else in the room?"

"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at 
the foot of the stairs."

"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"

"But witho
ut his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat."

"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"

"Never."

"Had he ev
er showed any signs of having taken opium?"

"Never."

"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points abo
ut which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very b
usy day to-morrow."

A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly be
tween the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had a
n unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging 
his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data 
were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat
 and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed a
nd cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched him
self cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of t
he lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the c
eiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline f
eatures. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I fou
nd the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and
 the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previo
us night.

"Awake, Watson?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Game for a morning drive?"

"Certainly."

"Then dress. No one is stir
ring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He chuckled to himself as he 
spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.

As I dressed I 
glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly fi
nished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.

"I want to test a little theory of 
mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most 
absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair
 now."

"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.

"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continue
d, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladsto
ne bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."

We made our way downstairs as quietly a
s possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable
-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirri
ng, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as so
me city in a dream.

"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. 
"I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."


In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets
 of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Stree
t wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and th
e two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.

"Who is on du
ty?" asked Holmes.

"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down
 the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "
Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, 
and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"


"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Nevil
le St. Clair, of Lee."

"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."

"So I heard. You have him here?
"

"In the cells."

"Is he quiet?"

"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."

"Dirty?"

"Yes, it is al
l we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been set
tled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."

"
I should like to see him very much."

"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag."

"No, 
I think that I'll take it."

"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred doo
r, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.

"The thi
rd on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
 and glanced through.

"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."

We both put our eyes to the grating. Th
e prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized ma
n, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He wa
s, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive u
gliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up on
e side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew 
low over his eyes and forehead.

"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.

"He certainly needs a wash," remarke
d Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladston
e bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckl
ed the inspector.

"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cu
t a much more respectable figure."

"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to th
e Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper
 half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his spo
nge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.

"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "t
o Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent."

Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face p
eeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar 
which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought awa
y the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired an
d smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposu
re, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.

"Great heavens!" cried the inspector,
 "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph."

The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a ma
n who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"

"With making away wit
h Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it," sai
d the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."

"I
f I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegall
y detained."

"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to have
 trusted you wife."

"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have
 them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"

Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the 
couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.

"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "o
f course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no p
ossible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the pape
rs. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the prop
er authorities. The case would then never go into court at all."

"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "
I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to 
my children.

"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I 
received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an even
ing paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volu
nteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an
 amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the s
ecrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I pa
inted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist 
by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took 
my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I p
lied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4
d.

"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend a
nd had a writ served upon me for $25. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I b
egged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in 
the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.

"Well, you can imagine how hard it wa
s to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with
 a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, 
but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, i
nspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper 
of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in 
the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his 
rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.

"Well, very soon I found that I was saving consider
able sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than
 my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, w
hich improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied b
y silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take $2.

"As I grew richer I grew more a
mbitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupa
tion. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.

"Last Monday I had finished for the d
ay and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishm
ent, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my
 arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to m
e. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on thos
e of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then i
t occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the win
dow, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seize
d my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carri
ed my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have follow
ed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confes
s, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.

"I do no
t know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, a
nd hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and co
nfided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her th
at she had no cause to fear."

"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.

"Good God! What a week she must 
have spent!"

"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he m
ight find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot 
all about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you n
ever been prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Brad
street. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."

"I have sworn it by the most
 solemn oaths which a man can take."

"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. B
ut if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for h
aving cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by si
tting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall ju
st be in time for breakfast."

VII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE


I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holme
s upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lo
unging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled m
orning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the ba
ck hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens a
nd a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpos
e of examination.

"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."

"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend wit
h whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the 
old hat--"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instructio
n."

I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and
 the windows were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has som
e deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the puni
shment of some crime."

"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those whimsical little incid
ents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few squa
re miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be e
xpected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being cr
iminal. We have already had experience of such."

"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have 
added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime."

"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recove
r the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twis
ted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, t
he commissionaire?"

"Yes."

"It is to him that this trophy belongs."

"It is his hat."

"No, no, he found it. Its ow
ner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, fir
st, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no 
doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morn
ing, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making 
his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a sl
ight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row br
oke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he r
aised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had ru
shed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seein
g an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid 
the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appeara
nce of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the s
hape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."

"Which surely he restored to their owner?"

"My
 dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was 
tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, b
ut as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to r
estore lost property to any one of them."

"What, then, did Peterson do?"

"He brought round both hat and goose to me
 on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until thi
s morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without
 unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I cont
inue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner."

"Did he not advertise?"

"No."

"The
n, what clue could you have as to his identity?"

"Only as much as we can deduce."

"From his hat?"

"Precisely."

"B
ut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?"

"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can
 you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?"

I took the tattered object in my
 hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much t
he worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, 
as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-secure
r, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, altho
ugh there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.

"I can see not
hing," said I, handing it back to my friend.

"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to
 reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."

"Then, pray tell me what it is that you ca
n infer from this hat?"

He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characterist
ic of him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences 
which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was 
highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last 
three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to
 a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, pr
obably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."

"M
y dear Holmes!"

"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance.
 "He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled 
hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent f
acts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on 
in his house."

"You are certainly joking, Holmes."

"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
 these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"

"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must con
fess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"

For answer Hol
mes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a 
question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a brain must have something in it."

"The decline of his f
ortunes, then?"

"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the v
ery best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expens
ive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."

"Well, that is c
lear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"

Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is 
the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "They are never sold upo
n hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take 
this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it,
 it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the 
other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sig
n that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."

"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."

"The further points, th
at he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all 
to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-en
ds, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cr
eam. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, 
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof posi
tive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training."

"But his wife--
you said that she had ceased to love him."

"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson,
 with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall f
ear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."

"But he might be a bachelor."

"Nay, 
he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."

"You have an
 answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"

"One tallow stain, 
or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the 
individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat i
n one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?
"

"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committe
d, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."

Sherlock Holmes had op
ened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with fl
ushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.

"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gaspe
d.

"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himsel
f round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.

"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its 
crop!" He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather 
smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark holl
ow of his hand.

Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed.
 I suppose you know what you have got?"

"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putt
y."

"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."

"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I e
jaculated.

"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in 
The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of
 $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."

"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The 
commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.

"That is the reward, and I have rea
son to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with 
half her fortune if she could but recover the gem."

"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," 
I remarked.

"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstr
acted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the As
sizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, 
until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:

"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robb
ery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewe
l-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the ho
tel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon 
the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained wi
th Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, tha
t the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Count
ess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Ho
rner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherin
e Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to havi
ng rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, 
gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest ter
ms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to d
eal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during
 the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."

"Hum! So much for the police-court,"
 said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leadi
ng from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, 
our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the st
one came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other ch
aracteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and 
ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and th
ese lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other metho
ds."

"What will you say?"

"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Stree
t, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker St
reet.' That is clear and concise."

"Very. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, sinc
e, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by t
he approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the imp
ulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every
one who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and hav
e this put in the evening papers."

"In which, sir?"

"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, 
Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."

"Very well, sir. And this stone?"

"Ah, yes, I shall keep the sto
ne. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have on
e to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."

When the commissionaire had gon
e, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and
 sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the 
larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found
 in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, 
save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There ha
ve been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-gr
ain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the 
prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."

"Do you think 
that this man Horner is innocent?"

"I cannot tell."

"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, h
ad anything to do with the matter?"

"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man
, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid go
ld. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."

"And you can 
do nothing until then?"

"Nothing."

"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in t
he evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."

"Very gl
ad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I 
ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."

I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six
 when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a 
coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. J
ust as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.

"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," s
aid he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily as
sume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more a
dapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"

"
Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."

He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intel
ligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight trem
or of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up 
in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. 
He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of lear
ning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.

"We have retained these things for some days," said 
Holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you
 did not advertise."

Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as th
ey once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and 
the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."

"Very naturally. By the way,
 about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.


"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sidebo
ard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"

"Oh, certainly, cer
tainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.

"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of 
your own bird, so if you wish--"

The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adve
nture," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to 
be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I per
ceive upon the sideboard."

Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.

"Ther
e is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other
 one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose."

"Certainly, sir," said Bak
er, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha I
nn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host,
 Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to
 receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, si
r, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed sol
emnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.

"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the d
oor behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"

"Not 
particularly."

"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."


"By all means."

It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, t
he stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pi
stol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harle
y Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alph
a Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed 
open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

"Your
 beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.

"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.

"Yes. I w
as speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."

"Ah! yes, I see. But you
 see, sir, them's not our geese."

"Indeed! Whose, then?"

"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garde
n."

"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"

"Breckinridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's y
our good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night."

"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, butto
ning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goo
se at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we
 can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a 
line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let u
s follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!"

We passed across Holborn, down Endell
 Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckin
ridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to
 put up the shutters.

"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.

The salesman nodded and shot a questioning gl
ance at my companion.

"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.

"Let you 
have five hundred to-morrow morning."

"That's no good."

"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."

"A
h, but I was recommended to you."

"Who by?"

"The landlord of the Alpha."

"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."


"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"

To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger
 from the salesman.

"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at
? Let's have it straight, now."

"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you suppl
ied to the Alpha."

"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"

"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know w
hy you should be so warm over such a trifle."

"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When 
I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who 
did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the w
orld, to hear the fuss that is made over them."

"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been maki
ng inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to bac
k my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred."

"Well, then, you'v
e lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped the salesman.

"It's nothing of the kind."

"I say it is."

"I don't 
believe it."

"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell 
you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred."

"You'll never persuade me to believe that."

"Will you 
bet, then?"

"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just 
to teach you not to be obstinate."

The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said he.

The small boy
 brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.


"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find tha
t there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"

"Well?"

"That's the list of the folk from whom I b
uy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their 
accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppli
ers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me."

"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.

"
Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."

Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, 
Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.' "

"Now, then, what's the last entry?"

" 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese 
at 7s. 6d.' "

"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"

" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.' "

"What h
ave you to say now?"

Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down 
upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped und
er a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.

"When you see a man with whis
kers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I dare
say that if I had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was dr
awn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest
, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whe
ther we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides o
urselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"

His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub whic
h broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the cen
tre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in 
the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.

"I've had enough of you and your geese
," he shouted. "I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'l
l set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy th
e geese off you?"

"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man.

"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshot
t for it."

"She told me to ask you."

"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it.
 Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.

"Ha! this may save u
s a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow." Stri
ding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the l
ittle man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of 
colour had been driven from his face.

"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.

"You wi
ll excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman jus
t now. I think that I could be of assistance to you."

"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"


"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know."

"But you can know nothing of
 this?"

"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oaksho
tt, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to h
is club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member."

"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried th
e little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in th
is matter."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a cos
y room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that
 I have the pleasure of assisting."

The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a
 sidelong glance.

"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with an alias."


A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James Ryder."

"Precisel
y so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everythi
ng which you would wish to know."

The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, ha
lf-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped
 into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our
 drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of t
he nervous tension within him.

"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very s
easonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers befor
e we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or r
ather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar acros
s the tail."

Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"

"It came here."


"Here?"

"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid 
an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum."


Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box an
d held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood
 glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly.
 "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to
 go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is
, to be sure!"

For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his ch
eeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.

"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the pro
ofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared
 up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?"

"It was Cather
ine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a crackling voice.

"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptati
on of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were n
ot very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in
 you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion w
ould rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your c
onfederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-c
ase, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--"

Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the
 rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my moth
er! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible.
 Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is v
ery well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which 
he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break dow
n."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the g
oose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety."

Ryde
r passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had b
een arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at 
what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hote
l where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a m
an named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I 
met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down 
my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told 
her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and won
dered what it would be best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serv
ing his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could 
get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up 
my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the 
stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hot
el. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning 
against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea c
ame into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some we
eks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as
 her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yar
d, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its b
ill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the st
one pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to k
now what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.

" 'Wh
atever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, a
nd I was feeling which was the fattest.'

" 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. I
t's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
 for the market.'

" 'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was h
andling just now.'

" 'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'

"
 'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.

" 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffe
d. 'Which is it you want, then?'

" 'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'

" 'Oh, 
very well. Kill it and take it with you.'

"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way
 to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughe
d until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the st
one, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried int
o the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.

" 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.

" 'Gone to the dea
ler's, Jem.'

" 'Which dealer's?'

" 'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'

" 'But was there another with a barred tail?'
 I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'

" 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them
 apart.'

"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinrid
ge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yours
elves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think th
at I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold
 my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.

There
 was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips u
pon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! Oh, Heaven 
bless you!"

"No more words. Get out!"

And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, t
he bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.

"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reac
hing up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in 
danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose 
that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; h
e is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season 
of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. 
If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird w
ill be the chief feature."

VIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND


On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd 
cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragi
c, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his
 art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend to
wards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented mo
re singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.
 The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bache
lors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was m
ade at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom th
e pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that th
ere are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible t
han the truth.

It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully
 dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that i
t was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I wa
s myself regular in my habits.

"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning.
 Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."

"What is it, then--a fire?"

"No; a client. I
t seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiti
ng now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock
 sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Sho
uld it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any ra
te, that I should call you and give you the chance."

"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."

I had no k
eener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as 
swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submi
tted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-
room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.

"Good-morn
ing, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,
 before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense t
o light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering
."

"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.

"What, th
en?"

"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed 
in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunt
ed animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and he
r expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.

"
You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I 
have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second h
alf of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a
 dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."

The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderm
ent at my companion.

"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is spatter
ed with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which th
rows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"Whatever your reasons may
 be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and c
ame in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have
 no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of
 you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from 
her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light
 through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but
 in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find 
me ungrateful."

Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.

"Farin
tosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Wat
son. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your frien
d. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to,
 at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming a
n opinion upon the matter."

"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my f
ears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that 
even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as t
he fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But 
I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me 
how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."

"I am all attention, madam."

"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am l
iving with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of St
oke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."

Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.

"The fa
mily was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the no
rth, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful 
disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left s
ave a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The la
st squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my s
tepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enable
d him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character,
 he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in 
the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long 
term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.

"When Dr. Roylott was in Indi
a he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Juli
a and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum
 of money--not less than $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, wit
h a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after o
ur return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott the
n abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral
 house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obs
tacle to our happiness.

"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends a
nd exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the
 old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoe
ver might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and i
n my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgrace
ful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and
 the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger
.

"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the mon
ey which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the 
wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which
 represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them som
etimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and
 he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers a
lmost as much as their master.

"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasur
e in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thir
ty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."

"Your sister is dead, 
then?"

"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, li
ving the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, howeve
r, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowe
d to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay maj
or of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offere
d no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible 
event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."

Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with 
his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.

"
Pray be precise as to details," said he.

"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seare
d into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedro
oms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bed
rooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is no communication between the
m, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"

"Perfectly so."

"The windows of the three
 rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had no
t retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smo
ke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wed
ding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.

" 'Tell me, Helen,' said s
he, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'

" 'Never,' said I.

" 'I suppose that you could n
ot possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'

" 'Certainly not. But why?'

" 'Because during the last few nights I 
have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I 
cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask yo
u whether you had heard it.'

" 'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'

" 'Very likel
y. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'

" 'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you
.'

" 'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments la
ter I heard her key turn in the lock."

"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at ni
ght?"

"Always."

"And why?"

"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no
 feeling of security unless our doors were locked."

"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."

"I could not slee
p that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, 
and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind
 was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of th
e gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from m
y bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, su
ch as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down 
the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not 
knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her
 face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. 
I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
 She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had
 not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my G
od! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stab
bed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked 
her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown
. When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medi
cal aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her conscio
usness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."

"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle
 and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"

"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my str
ong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly
 have been deceived."

"Was your sister dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the c
harred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."

"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her whe
n the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"

"He investigated the case 
with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satis
factory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were 
blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully soun
ded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result.
 The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alon
e when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."

"How about poison?"

"The doctors ex
amined her for it, but without success."

"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"

"It is my be
lief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."

"Were t
here gipsies in the plantation at the time?"

"Yes, there are nearly always some there."

"Ah, and what did you gathe
r from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"

"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of deli
rium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I 
do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the st
range adjective which she used."

Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.

"These are very 
deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative."

"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been unt
il lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the 
honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Wat
er, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the
 spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierce
d, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she sle
pt. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly h
eard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the 
lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon
 as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, fro
m whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."

"You have done wisel
y," said my friend. "But have you told me all?"

"Yes, all."

"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your ste
pfather."

"Why, what do you mean?"

For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand tha
t lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the 
white wrist.

"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.

The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist
. "He is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."

There was a long silence, during whi
ch Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.

"This is a very deep business," he said
 at last. "There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet 
we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these
 rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"

"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most
 important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We 
have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."

"Excellent. You are 
not averse to this trip, Watson?"

"By no means."

"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"

"I 
have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train
, so as to be there in time for your coming."

"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some smal
l business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"

"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already sin
ce I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick
 black veil over her face and glided from the room.

"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes
, leaning back in his chair.

"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."

"Dark enough and sinister en
ough."

"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and c
himney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."

"What beco
mes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"

"I cannot think."


"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with th
is old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepda
ughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang
, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I th
ink that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."

"But what, then, did the 
gipsies do?"

"I cannot imagine."

"I see many objections to any such theory."

"And so do I. It is precisely for tha
t reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be
 explained away. But what in the name of the devil!"

The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact th
at our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a 
peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair o
f high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar 
of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrin
kles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while h
is deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bi
rd of prey.

"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.

"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said
 my companion quietly.

"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."

"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray ta
ke a seat."

"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been sayi
ng to you?"

"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.

"What has she been saying to you?" screame
d the old man furiously.

"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.

"
Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, y
ou scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."

My friend smiled.

"Holmes, the busybody!"


His smile broadened.

"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"

Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is mo
st entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."

"I will go when I have 
said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a da
ngerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with h
is huge brown hands.

"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the
 fireplace he strode out of the room.

"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bu
lky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke h
e picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.

"Fancy his having the insolence to
 confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only tr
ust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, 
we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which m
ay help us in this matter."

It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in h
is hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.

"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," sa
id he. "To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with whi
ch it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100, is now, throug
h the fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage
. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even on
e of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that
 he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too seri
ous for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are 
ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into 
your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and 
a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."

At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, wh
ere we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a per
fect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing o
ut their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was 
a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My com
panion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his b
reast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the 
meadows.

"Look there!" said he.

A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at 
the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.


"Stoke Moran?" said he.

"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.

"There is some
 building going on there," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."

"There's the village," said the driver, pointi
ng to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to g
et over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."

"And the lady,
 I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."

We got
 off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.

"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we 
climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It ma
y stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."

Our client of the mo
rning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she c
ried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely 
that he will be back before evening."

"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, a
nd in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"Good hea
vens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe f
rom him. What will he say when he returns?"

"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunni
ng than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away
 to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which w
e are to examine."

The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wing
s, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with 
wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair
, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up fr
om the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wal
l, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes
 walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.

"This,
 I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the 
main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"

"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."

"Pending the altera
tions, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."


"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."

"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the oth
er side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"


"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."

"As you both locked your doors at night, your r
ooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?
"

Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to f
orce the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.
 Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" 
said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass t
hese shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."

A small side 
door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third cham
ber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met 
with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old count
ry-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-t
able on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furnitur
e in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were 
of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holm
es drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, tak
ing in every detail of the apartment.

"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick 
bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.

"It goes to the housekeeper's r
oom."

"It looks newer than the other things?"

"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."

"Your sister ask
ed for it, I suppose?"

"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."

"In
deed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy my
self as to this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward an
d forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the c
hamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up
 and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's a dummy," said he.


"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fast
ened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."

"How very absurd! I never noticed that be
fore."

"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular points about this r
oom. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, 
he might have communicated with the outside air!"

"That is also quite modern," said the lady.

"Done about the same 
time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.

"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."

"The
y seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With y
our permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."

Dr. Grimesby Roylott's cha
mber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full o
f books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round 
table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined eac
h and all of them with the keenest interest.

"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.

"My stepfather's busines
s papers."

"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"

"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."

"
There isn't a cat in it, for example?"

"No. What a strange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer o
f milk which stood on the top of it.

"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."

"Ah, yes, of c
ourse! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I da
resay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examin
ed the seat of it with the greatest attention.

"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his l
ens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"

The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash 
hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.


"What do you make of that, Watson?"

"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied."

"That is n
ot quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the wor
st of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
."

I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this inv
estigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon 
his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.

"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you shou
ld absolutely follow my advice in every respect."

"I shall most certainly do so."

"The matter is too serious for an
y hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance."

"I assure you that I am in your hands."

"In the first pla
ce, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."

Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.

"
Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?"

"Yes, that is the Crown."

"
Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"

"Certainly."

"You must confine yourself to your room, on pret
ence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the s
hutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everythi
ng which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs
, you could manage there for one night."

"Oh, yes, easily."

"The rest you will leave in our hands."

"But what will
 you do?"

"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturb
ed you."

"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my
 companion's sleeve.

"Perhaps I have."

"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."

"
I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."

"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct,
 and if she died from some sudden fright."

"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangibl
e cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.
 Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away 
the dangers that threaten you."

Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at th
e Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the
 inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up 
beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates
, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. 
The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one
 of the sitting-rooms.

"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have real
ly some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."

"Can I be of assistance?"

"Your
 presence might be invaluable."

"Then I shall certainly come."

"It is very kind of you."

"You speak of danger. You
 have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."

"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little 
more. I imagine that you saw all that I did."

"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that co
uld answer I confess is more than I can imagine."

"You saw the ventilator, too?"

"Yes, but I do not think that it i
s such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass t
hrough."

"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."

"My dear Holmes!"

"Oh, yes,
 I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that s
uggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would 
have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."

"But what harm can there be in that?"

"W
ell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in
 the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"

"I cannot as yet see any connection."

"Did you observe anything very pecu
liar about that bed?"

"No."

"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"

"I ca
nnot say that I have."

"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the vent
ilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."

"Holmes," I cried, 
"I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."

"
Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has 
knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, 
Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for 
goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."

About nine o
'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours pa
ssed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of
 us.

"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."

As we passed out 
he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and tha
t it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blow
ing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.


There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our w
ay among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump
 of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with 
writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.

"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"

Hol
mes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke in
to a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.

"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."

I had forgo
tten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulder
s at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my sh
oes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, 
and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trump
et of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:

"
The least sound would be fatal to our plans."

I nodded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit without light. He wou
ld see it through the ventilator."

I nodded again.

"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your 
pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."

I took out my rev
olver and laid it on the corner of the table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the be
d beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were l
eft in darkness.

How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a br
eath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension i
n which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

From outside 
came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that t
he cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every q
uarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat w
aiting silently for whatever might befall.

Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of 
the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Some
one in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, t
hough the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible
--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant th
at we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.

"Yo
u see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"

But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a 
low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at
 which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and l
oathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of th
e night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain a
nd fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the dis
tant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Hol
mes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.

"What can it mean?
" I gasped.

"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your 
pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. 
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his he
els, with the cocked pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lanter
n with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Besi
de this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protr
uding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the lo
ng lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid 
stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seeme
d to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The band! the speckled band!"
 whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself 
from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"It is a swamp adder!" cri
ed Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, re
coil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back
 into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has ha
ppened."

As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile'
s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he close
d upon it.

Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I 
should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the te
rrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow proces
s of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous
 pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.


"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is t
o reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the p
oor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, we
re sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my pos
ition when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come eit
her from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilat
or, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clampe
d to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing throug
h the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowled
ge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track
. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one 
as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison wo
uld take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who co
uld distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I tho
ught of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had tr
ained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this 
ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed
. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she m
ust fall a victim.

"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair s
howed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should 
reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally disp
el any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
 hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps whi
ch I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, an
d I instantly lit the light and attacked it."

"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."

"And also wit
h the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and rous
ed its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible
 for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."

IX.
  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB


Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Ho
lmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his 
notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded
 a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in i
ts details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for t
hose deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told
 more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en 
bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears 
gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumsta
nces made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.

It was in th
e summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had return
ed to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him a
nd occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had stead
ily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from
 among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertisi
ng my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.

One morning, a
t a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come fro
m Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway case
s were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and clos
ed the door tightly behind him.

"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all ri
ght."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up 
in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. T
here he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you." And off he went, thi
s trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated b
y the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my b
ooks. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young
, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me
 the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to cont
rol.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident during the nigh
t. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow
 very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table."

I took i
t up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the na
me, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my libra
ry-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my ni
ght could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leani
ng back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried;
 "pull yourself together!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however. He was off in one of
 those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he cam
e to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.

"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.

"Not at all.
 Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

"That'
s better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my th
umb used to be."

He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to loo
k at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had
 been hacked or torn right out from the roots.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have ble
d considerably."

"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long ti
me. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wr
ist and braced it up with a twig."

"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."

"It is a question of hydraulics, yo
u see, and came within my own province."

"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sha
rp instrument."

"A thing like a cleaver," said he.

"An accident, I presume?"

"By no means."

"What! a murderous at
tack?"

"Very murderous indeed."

"You horrify me."

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered
 it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to
 time.

"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.

"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man
. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."

"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is
 evidently trying to your nerves."

"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between oursel
ves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my stat
ement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, eve
n if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done
."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly re
commend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police."

"Oh, I have heard of t
hat fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must 
use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to 
him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged to you."

"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to
 have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.
"

"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter 
shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.

Sherl
ock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The 
Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of 
the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly gen
ial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new
 acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.


"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and 
make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a 
little stimulant."

"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I th
ink that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I sha
ll start at once upon my peculiar experiences."

Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expressi
on which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange sto
ry which our visitor detailed to us.

"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone i
n lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work duri
ng the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, hav
ing served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to sta
rt in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.

"I suppose that everyone finds his firs
t independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had 
three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings
 amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until
 at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.

"Yesterday, how
ever, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished 
to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close
 at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not thi
nk that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks 
was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no d
isease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his a
ge, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.

" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent
. 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is
 also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.'

"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
 address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'

" 'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not te
ll you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are re
siding alone in London.'

" 'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see h
ow all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wis
hed to speak to me?'

" 'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a profession
al commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we ma
y expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'

" 'If I promise to k
eep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'

"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it s
eemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

" 'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.


" 'Yes, I promise.'

" 'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, e
ither in word or writing?'

" 'I have already given you my word.'

" 'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting 
like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.

" 'That's all right,' said he,
 coming back. 'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He 
drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

"
A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this flesh
less man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.

" 'I beg that you will 
state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words cam
e to my lips.

" 'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.

" 'Most admirably.'

" 'I say a ni
ght's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine whi
ch has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such 
a commission as that?'

" 'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'

" 'Precisely so. We shall want you 
to come to-night by the last train.'

" 'Where to?'

" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the border
s of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at 
about 11:15.'

" 'Very good.'

" 'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'

" 'There is a drive, then?'

" 'Yes,
 our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'

" 'Then we can hardly 
get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the nigh
t.'

" 'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'

" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenie
nt hour?'

" 'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we
 are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession.
 Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'

"I thought of t
he fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to accommo
date myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me t
o do.'

" 'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused
 your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that 
we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'

" 'Entirely.'

" 'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware th
at fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?'

" 'I have heard
 so.'

" 'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortuna
te enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I fou
nd that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon 
the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignoran
t that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy 
their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took
 a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own li
ttle deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This
 we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This p
ress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secre
t very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it
 would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these field
s and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you ar
e going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'

" 'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which 
I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as
 I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.'

" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress
 the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken
 you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shal
l expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'

" 'I shall certainly be there.'

" 'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at
 me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.


"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudd
en commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfol
d what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to 
other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I coul
d not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midni
ght, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a h
earty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongu
e.

"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyf
ord, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and t
here was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate
, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he graspe
d my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, 
tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."

"One horse?" interjected Holmes.

"Yes, on
ly one."

"Did you observe the colour?"

"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It 
was a chestnut."

"Tired-looking or fresh?"

"Oh, fresh and glossy."

"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you.
 Pray continue your most interesting statement."

"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysa
nder Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from th
e time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware
, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads s
eem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the win
dows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the oc
casional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, bu
t the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the
 road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander St
ark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, 
as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the fr
ont of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintl
y the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.

"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled 
about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and
 a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand
, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and fro
m the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words 
in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she
 gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her 
ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in h
is hand.

" 'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open anoth
er door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German bo
oks were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall not keep you
 waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished into the darkness.

"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite 
of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry.
 Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, 
heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewh
ere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. 
Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was th
e place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no ide
a. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so se
cluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and
 down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fif
ty-guinea fee.

"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swu
ng slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my
 lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight s
ent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered wor
ds of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.

" '
I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There i
s no good for you to do.'

" 'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave unti
l I have seen the machine.'

" 'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no 
one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a st
ep forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is 
too late!'

"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obs
tacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed
 to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and
 without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, there
fore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention o
f remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several
 footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and 
vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.

"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thic
k man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson
.

" 'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this d
oor shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'

" 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself be
cause I felt the room to be a little close.'

"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proc
eed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.'

" 'I had better put my ha
t on, I suppose.'

" 'Oh, no, it is in the house.'

" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'

" 'No, no. This i
s only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know 
what is wrong with it.'

"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind hi
m. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the
 thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of
 any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through
 in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warni
ngs of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to b
e a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.

"C
olonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which
 the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.

" 'We are n
ow,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone 
were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down w
ith the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the 
force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, bu
t there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the good
ness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.'

"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine 
very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, ho
wever, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight 
leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of 
the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along 
which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed
 my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When 
I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my o
wn curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it woul
d be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wo
od, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic dep
osit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamati
on in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.

" 'What are you doing there?' he asked.


"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your full
er's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact 
purpose was for which it was used.'

"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His
 face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.

" 'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about th
e machine.' He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and
 pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'Hullo!' I yell
ed. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'

"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mout
h. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp stil
l stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was
 coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute 
grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I i
mplored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only 
a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through 
my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the
 weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and 
yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to st
and erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.

"I have said that though the 
floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of 
yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an in
stant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself t
hrough, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, a
nd a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.

"I was recal
led to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, 
while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same
 good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.

" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here i
n a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'

"This time, at l
east, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair
. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shout
ing of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped
 and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through 
the window of which the moon was shining brightly.

" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be 
that you can jump it.'

"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean 
figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in 
the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the 
garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I 
hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she wer
e ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through m
y mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him ba
ck.

" 'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be ag
ain. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'

" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from he
r. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to
 the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his
 blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.

"I was shaken but no
t hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood th
at I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
 I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been c
ut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a 
sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.

"How long I remained uncons
cious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking whe
n I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded t
humb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet 
with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round 
me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and ju
st a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I h
ad arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dre
adful hours might have been an evil dream.

"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. T
here would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arr
ived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he obse
rved a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was 
one about three miles off.

"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got bac
k to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my 
wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall d
o exactly what you advise."

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrat
ive. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cu
ttings.

"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the papers about a year ago
. Listen to this: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodg
ings at ten o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the la
st time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."

"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then th
at explains what the girl said."

"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who 
was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who
 will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
 go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."

Some three hours or so afterwards we wer
e all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydr
aulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ord
nance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre
.

"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must 
be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."

"It was an hour's good drive."

"And you think that 
they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?"

"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, to
o, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."

"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have spare
d you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."


"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."

"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,"
 said Bradstreet. "Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in
 search of are to be found."

"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.

"Really, now!" cried the i
nspector, "you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the coun
try is more deserted there."

"And I say east," said my patient.

"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "T
here are several quiet little villages up there."

"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, a
nd our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any."

"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a ve
ry pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"

"You are 
all wrong."

"But we can't all be."

"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the centre of the 
circle. "This is where we shall find them."

"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.

"Six out and six back. N
othing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had 
gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"

"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "Of cou
rse there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."

"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large s
cale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."

"We have known for some ti
me that a clever gang was at work," said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We e
ven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed t
hat they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."

But
 the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled in
to Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neigh
bourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.

"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the tra
in steamed off again on its way.

"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.

"When did it break out?"

"I hear that it was
 during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becher'
s."

"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"

The station-mas
ter laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lin
ed waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks a
s if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."

The station-master had not finished his speech before we we
re all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewash
ed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines 
were vainly striving to keep the flames under.

"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gr
avel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."

"Well, at 
least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, 
when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase af
ter you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I ver
y much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now."

And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day
 to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Ea
rly that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the 
direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to di
scover the least clue as to their whereabouts.

The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which
 they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second
 floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the
 roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iro
n piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses o
f nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained t
he presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.

How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed f
rom the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the so
ft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarka
bly small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, bei
ng less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way 
of danger.

"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been a pre
tty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?"

"Experience,"
 said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the repu
tation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence."

X.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR


Th
e Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted
 circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details h
ave drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts h
ave never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing 
the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.


It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Stree
t, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors a
ll day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had 
brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one 
easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with
 the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelop
e upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.

"Here is a very fashionable epis
tle," I remarked as he entered. "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter
."

"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually t
he more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored
 or to lie."

He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, 
after all."

"Not social, then?"

"No, distinctly professional."

"And from a noble client?"

"One of the highest in 
England."

"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."

"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my c
lient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also ma
y not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"

"It 
looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."

"It is fo
rtunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. Th
e latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. S
imon and his wedding?"

"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."

"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is f
rom Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bea
rs upon the matter. This is what he says:

" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place 
implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult yo
u in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland 
Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he 
even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have a
ny other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours 
faithfully,


" 'ST. SIMON.'

"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has 
had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as he folde
d up the epistle.

"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."

"Then I have just time, with
 your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of ti
me, while I take a glance as to who our client is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference 
beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. " 'Lord Robert Walsi
ngham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess 
sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies
 in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantage
net blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. 
I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid."

"I have very little difficulty in finding what I 
want," said I, "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you
, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."

"Oh, you
 mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was 
obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."

"Here is the first notice which I ca
n find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has bee
n arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second
 son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal.
, U.S.A.' That is all."

"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.


"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will so
on be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily agai
nst our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our
 fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the p
rizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty ye
ars proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Dora
n, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracte
d much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry wil
l run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke o
f Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property o
f his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an
 alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' 
"

"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.

"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say t
hat the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a
 dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate wh
ich has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement th
at the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. T
hose are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."

"Before the what?" asked Holmes with
 a start.

"The vanishing of the lady."

"When did she vanish, then?"

"At the wedding breakfast."

"Indeed. This is 
more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."

"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the c
ommon."

"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind any
thing quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details."

"I warn you that they are very incomplete."

"Perhaps 
we may make them less so."

"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday
, which I will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':

" 'The family of Lord Robe
rt St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken pla
ce in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the pre
vious morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persist
ently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now
 been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversat
ion.

" 'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being presen
t save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Cl
ara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party procee
ded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears t
hat some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way 
into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a pain
ful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered th
e house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden
 indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, bu
t learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and 
hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but
 had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daugh
ter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communicatio
n with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of
 this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of 
the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest
 of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she ma
y have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.' "

"And is that all?"

"Only one little item in ano
ther of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."

"And it is--"

"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had ca
used the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and tha
t she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands 
now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."

"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I 
would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes
 after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very m
uch prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."

"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, 
throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perh
aps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been t
o command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for
 he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very c
urly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
 foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-col
oured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand 
the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.

"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray take th
e basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matt
er over."

"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I
 understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were h
ardly from the same class of society."

"No, I am descending."

"I beg pardon."

"My last client of the sort was a ki
ng."

"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"

"The King of Scandinavia."

"What! Had he lost his wife?"

"You c
an understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promi
se to you in yours."

"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to giv
e you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion."

"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in
 the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disap
pearance of the bride."

Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."

"But it needs a gr
eat deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly b
y questioning you."

"Pray do so."

"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"

"In San Francisco, a year ago."

"Yo
u were travelling in the States?"

"Yes."

"Did you become engaged then?"

"No."

"But you were on a friendly footing
?"

"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused."

"Her father is very rich?"

"He is said to b
e the richest man on the Pacific slope."

"And how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had nothing a few years ag
o. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."

"Now, what is your own impression as to the y
oung lady's--your wife's character?"

The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "
You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free
 in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than fro
m the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any s
ort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in
 carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear
"--he gave a little stately cough--"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capabl
e of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."

"Have you her photograph?"

"
I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photogra
ph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark 
eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to
 Lord St. Simon.

"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"

"Yes, her father brought
 her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her."

"S
he brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"

"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."

"And this, of
 course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?"

"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."


"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?"

"Yes."

"Was she in good spirits?"

"Nev
er better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives."

"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the
 morning of the wedding?"

"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."

"And did you observe 
any change in her then?"

"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper w
as just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the cas
e."

"Pray let us have it, for all that."

"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry
. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentl
eman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to he
r of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over th
is trifling cause."

"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present,
 then?"

"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."

"This gentleman was not one of your wi
fe's friends?"

"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly notic
ed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."

"Lady St. Simon, then, retur
ned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her fat
her's house?"

"I saw her in conversation with her maid."

"And who is her maid?"

"Alice is her name. She is an Amer
ican and came from California with her."

"A confidential servant?"

"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her 
mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different
 way."

"How long did she speak to this Alice?"

"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."

"You did not
 overhear what they said?"

"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang o
f the kind. I have no idea what she meant."

"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do 
when she finished speaking to her maid?"

"She walked into the breakfast-room."

"On your arm?"

"No, alone. She was 
very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, 
muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back."

"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, dep
oses that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."

"Quite
 so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, 
and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning."

"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars
 as to this young lady, and your relations to her."

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "
We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegr
o. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women ar
e, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me d
readful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marri
age celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door
 just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, a
nd even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows th
ere in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a 
row."

"Did your wife hear all this?"

"No, thank goodness, she did not."

"And she was seen walking with this very w
oman afterwards?"

"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Fl
ora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."

"Well, it is a possible supposition."

"You think so, 
too?"

"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"

"I do not think Flora would
 hurt a fly."

"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took 
place?"

"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask m
e, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness th
at she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."

"
In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I wil
l not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other f
ashion."

"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I 
think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see 
out of the window?"

"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."

"Quite so. Then I do not think that I n
eed to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you."

"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," sai
d our client, rising.

"I have solved it."

"Eh? What was that?"

"I say that I have solved it."

"Where, then, is my
 wife?"

"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will 
take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"It is
 very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing
. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusi
ons as to the case before our client came into the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of several similar cases,
 though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture int
o a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quot
e Thoreau's example."

"But I have heard all that you have heard."

"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing 
cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much 
the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestra
de! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."

T
he official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he 
carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offe
red to him.

"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."

"And I feel dissati
sfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."

"Really! You 
surprise me."

"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at wo
rk upon it all day."

"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-j
acket.

"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."

"In heaven's name, what for?"

"In search of the body of Lady St
. Simon."

Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar S
quare fountain?" he asked.

"Why? What do you mean?"

"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
 the one as in the other."

Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snar
led.

"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."

"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpent
ine plays no part in the matter?"

"I think it very unlikely."

"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that 
we found this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pa
ir of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, putting
 a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!"
 said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"

"No. They were found float
ing near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the cloth
es were there the body would not be far off."

"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in t
he neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicati
ng Flora Millar in the disappearance."

"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Are you, indeed, now?" cried
 Lestrade with some bitterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your i
nferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."

"And how?"


"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He s
lapped it down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. 
H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with conf
ederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was
 no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."

"Very good, Lestrade," 
said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a listless way, but 
his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he
.

"Ha! you find it so?"

"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."

Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head 
to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"

"On the contrary, this is the right side."

"The ri
ght side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here."

"And over here is what appears to be the fragme
nt of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."

"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. " 'Oc
t. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."

"Very 
likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, s
o I congratulate you again."

"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in si
tting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matt
er first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.

"Just one hint to you, Lest
rade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is 
a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person."

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he tur
ned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door b
ehind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," h
e remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."

It was after five o'clock when 
Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a
 very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my ve
ry great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahoga
ny. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and co
bwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nigh
ts, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.

Just before nine o'
clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye 
which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.

"They have laid the supper, then," he said
, rubbing his hands.

"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we may have some company 
dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step 
now upon the stairs."

It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vig
orously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

"My messenger reached you, t
hen?" asked Holmes.

"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for wh
at you say?"

"The best possible."

Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.

"What wi
ll the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

"It is
 the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation."

"Ah, you look on these things from another stan
dpoint."

"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though he
r abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a
 crisis."

"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.

"You mu
st make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."

"I will make no allowance. I am very a
ngry indeed, and I have been shamefully used."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on 
the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocat
e here who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he
 "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met."

At the si
ght of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
 thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and
 had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, fo
r her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.

"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have e
very cause to be."

"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated
 you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I
 saw Frank here again I just didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint 
right there before the altar."

"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you e
xplain this matter?"

"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much s
ecrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it." He wa
s a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.

"Then I'll tell our story right awa
y," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. W
e were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor F
rank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wo
uldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, t
hough; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad t
o know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come 
back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself
 not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will f
eel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed i
t all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off t
o seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.

"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went p
rospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a mi
ners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, 
and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a wo
rd of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 
'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no
 man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

"Still, if I had marr
ied Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions. I went
 to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine 
what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of t
he first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of questio
n in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that everythin
g was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to
 do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I w
as thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper
, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and 
he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he ma
de the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determine
d to do just whatever he might direct.

"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had alw
ays been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought
 to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made
 up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the 
window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on m
y things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from 
the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her a
nd soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square,
 and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had esca
ped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had c
ome upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."

"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It ga
ve the name and the church but not where the lady lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was
 all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of
 them again--just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all tho
se lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clot
hes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no on
e could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Ho
lmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly a
nd kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were 
so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to
 his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that
 you do not think very meanly of me."

Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened wi
th a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to di
scuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands be
fore I go?"

"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which sh
e extended to him.

"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."

"I think 
that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developm
ents, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all
 a very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.

"Then I trust that you at lea
st will honour me with your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for
 I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will no
t prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quar
tering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."

"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when o
ur visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which
 at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrate
d by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard."

"
You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"

"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the l
ady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minute
s of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What
 could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of th
e bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short 
a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the me
re sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of 
exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he posse
ss so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spen
t in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When
 he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note a
s the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-ju
mping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole
 situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous hus
band--the chances being in favour of the latter."

"And how in the world did you find them?"

"It might have been dif
ficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials we
re, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled hi
s bill at one of the most select London hotels."

"How did you deduce the select?"

"By the select prices. Eight shil
lings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many 
in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an insp
ection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over 
the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be fo
rwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I
 ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they s
hould make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited 
them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."

"But with no very good result," I remarked
. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."

"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very 
gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife a
nd of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely 
to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still 
to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings."

XI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET


"Holmes," sa
id I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rathe
r sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."

My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with
 his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, an
d the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre o
f Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up
 edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but w
as still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metr
opolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was 
a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He wa
s dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey t
rousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, w
ith occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he
 ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.


"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the houses."

"I believe t
hat he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me pro
fessionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowin
g, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.

A few moments later 
he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes tha
t our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his
 body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly spring
ing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to 
the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand 
and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

"You have come to me to tell y
our story, have you not?" said he. "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, an
d then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me."

The man sat for a minute o
r more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lip
s tight, and turned his face towards us.

"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that you have had some great 
trouble," responded Holmes.

"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terr
ible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Priv
ate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enoug
h to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
 out of this horrible affair."

"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who yo
u are and what it is that has befallen you."

"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I 
am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."

The name was indeed well kn
own to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. Wha
t could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, a
ll curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.

"I feel that time is of value," said he
; "that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to 
Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why
 I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts b
efore you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.

"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking 
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing ou
r connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of
 loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, an
d there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, o
r plate.

"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the cle
rks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no
 more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted
 names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once 
into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

" 'Mr. Holder,' said he
, 'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'

" 'The firm does so when the security is good
.' I answered.

" 'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have $50,000 at once. I could, of cours
e, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to 
carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under
 obligations.'

" 'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

" 'Next Monday I have a large sum due to
 me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But
 it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.'

" 'I should be happy to advance it without furth
er parley from my own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. I
f, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even i
n your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'

" 'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raisin
g up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?
'

" 'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,' said I.

" 'Precisely.' He opened the case, and the
re, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'There are th
irty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would pu
t the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'


"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

" 'You doub
t its value?' he asked.

" 'Not at all. I only doubt--'

" 'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at 
rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to 
reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'

" 'Ample.'

" 'You understand, Mr. Holder, tha
t I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I 
rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this
 coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any har
m were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the
 world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidenc
e, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'

"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more
 but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with 
the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense resp
onsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scand
al would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. 
However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my wor
k.

"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Ba
nkers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in whi
ch I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward a
nd forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove o
ut to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and l
ocked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.

"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thorou
ghly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have t
hree maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. A
nother, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent char
acter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have o
ccasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a th
oroughly good girl in every way.

"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me lo
ng to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a gri
evous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely 
I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for 
a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been s
terner, but I meant it for the best.

"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he
 was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of 
large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners
, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at ca
rds and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advan
ce upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dange
rous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw
 him back again.

"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence ov
er him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascina
tion of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen
 everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away 
from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes
 that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's qu
ick insight into character.

"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died fi
ve years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She i
s a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and g
entle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has sh
e ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she
 has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that hi
s marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

"Now, Mr. Holmes, you
 know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.

"When we were taking coffee i
n the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which 
we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am su
re, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to se
e the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.

" 'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.

" 'In my 
own bureau.'

" 'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.

" 'It is locked up,
' I answered.

" 'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key o
f the box-room cupboard.'

"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed
 me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.

" 'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'ca
n you let me have $200?'

" 'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous with you in money matte
rs.'

" 'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the 
club again.'

" 'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.

" 'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,
' said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, th
en I must try other means.'

"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a
 farthing from me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.

"When he was gone I unlocked 
my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that
 all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I 
came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached
.

" 'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out 
to-night?'

" 'Certainly not.'

" 'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to t
he side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'

" 'You must speak to her in 
the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'

" 'Quite sure, dad.'

" 'Then, g
ood-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.

"I am endeavouring to tell you ev
erything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point wh
ich I do not make clear."

"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."

"I come to a part of my story now 
in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no do
ubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. I
t had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somew
here. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly
 in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room d
oor.

" 'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'

"The gas was half up, as I 
had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the c
oronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it 
from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of 
the beryls in it, was missing.

" 'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You h
ave dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'

" 'Stolen!' he cried.

" 'Yes, thief!' I ro
ared, shaking him by the shoulder.

" 'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.

" 'There are t
hree missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tea
r off another piece?'

" 'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say
 another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and mak
e my own way in the world.'

" 'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage.
 'I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.'

" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such a
s I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'


"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my 
room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down s
enseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When
 the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me wheth
er it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become
 a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in e
verything.

" 'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as m
ine if I might leave the house for five minutes.'

" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you
 have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember th
at not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scan
dal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three mi
ssing stones.

" 'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could
 make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls ar
e, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'

" 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning aw
ay from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way
 for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of
 his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them cou
ld be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was r
emoved to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to 
use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of i
t. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of $1000. My God, what shall 
I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a hand on either side of
 his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.

Sherlock 
Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

"Do you receive muc
h company?" he asked.

"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwel
l has been several times lately. No one else, I think."

"Do you go out much in society?"

"Arthur does. Mary and I s
tay at home. We neither of us care for it."

"That is unusual in a young girl."

"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, 
she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty."

"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to he
r also."

"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."

"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"


"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."

"I hardly consider that a conclusi
ve proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?"

"Yes, it was twisted."

"Do you not think, then, that he
 might have been trying to straighten it?"

"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is 
too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"

"Precisely. 
And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several sin
gular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"

"They consider
ed that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."

"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would 
slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"

"They are sti
ll sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them."

"Have they thought of looking outsi
de the house?"

"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined."

"N
ow, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than ei
ther you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceed
ingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at g
reat risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion 
of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can fin
d them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger 
of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a ge
sture of despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"

"It is our task to find that out," r
eplied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glan
cing a little more closely into details."

My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I 
was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I co
nfess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I
 had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfi
ed with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his c
hin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken f
resh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat wit
h me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residen
ce of the great financier.

Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the ro
ad. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the 
entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretchi
ng from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the s
tables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left u
s standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so rou
nd by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and wait
ed by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in
. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute
 pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were
 bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greate
r sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a 
woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to h
er uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.

"You have given orders that Arthur should be
 liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked.

"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."

"But I am so
 sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be 
sorry for having acted so harshly."

"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"Who knows? Perhaps because he was
 so angry that you should suspect him."

"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet i
n his hand?"

"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Le
t the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"

"I shall never let it d
rop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. F
ar from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."

"This gen
tleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable 
lane now."

"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is
 he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent
 of this crime."

"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going b
ack to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I
 ask you a question or two?"

"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."

"You heard nothing yo
urself last night?"

"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down."

"You shut 
up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?"

"Yes."

"Were they all fastened this mor
ning?"

"Yes."

"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she ha
d been out to see him?"

"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's re
marks about the coronet."

"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may 
have planned the robbery."

"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I
 have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"

"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to th
at. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?"

"Yes; when I went to see if th
e door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"Do you know him?"

"Oh,
 yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."

"He stood," said Holmes,
 "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"

"Yes, he did."


"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"

Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why,
 you are like a magician," said she. "How do you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes' 
thin, eager face.

"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over the outside
 of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."

He walked swiftly round 
from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened 
and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said h
e at last.

The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, an
d a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

"Which key was used to open it?" he as
ked.

"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."

"Have you it here?"

"That is 
it on the dressing-table."

Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It
 is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it." He op
ened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's a
rt, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, w
here a corner holding three gems had been torn away.

"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corre
sponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."

The banker recoiled in
 horror. "I should not dream of trying," said he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but with
out result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take 
me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, M
r. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of you
r bed and that you heard nothing of it?"

"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."

"But perhaps it may g
row lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?"

"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."

"Your 
son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"

"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."

"Thank you
. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault 
if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigati
ons outside."

He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task
 more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features
 as inscrutable as ever.

"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve 
you best by returning to my rooms."

"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"

"I cannot tell."

The banker wrung 
his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"

"My opinion is in no way alter
ed."

"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"

"If you can call u
pon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it c
learer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that 
you place no limit on the sum I may draw."

"I would give my fortune to have them back."

"Very good. I shall look in
to the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before eve
ning."

It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions w
ere was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him up
on the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet 
three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes d
ressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he w
as a perfect sample of the class.

"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplac
e. "I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this matte
r, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few ho
urs." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrust
ing this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.

I had just finished my tea when he returned, 
evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and 
helped himself to a cup of tea.

"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."

"Where to?"

"Oh, t
o the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be lat
e."

"How are you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last
, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.
 However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respecta
ble self."

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply.
 His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minu
tes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.

I wait
ed until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to 
be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not
 know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in 
one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.

"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watso
n," said he, "but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."

"Why, it is after nine
 now," I answered. "I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."

It was, indeed, our friend
 the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and 
massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a 
weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily in
to the armchair which I pushed forward for him.

"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. "
Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishon
oured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."

"Deserted you?"

"Yes
. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had sa
id to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. P
erhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:

" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--
I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never
 have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must l
eave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for i
t will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving


" 'MARY.'

"What co
uld she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"

"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perha
ps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."

"Ha! You say so!
 You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?"

"You would not think $1000 a
piece an excessive sum for them?"

"I would pay ten."

"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matt
er. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000."

W
ith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular
 piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

With a shriek of joy our client clutched it 
up.

"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"

The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been
, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holme
s rather sternly.

"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."

"No, the debt is not to me. You owe
 a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to se
e my own son do, should I ever chance to have one."

"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"

"I told you yesterday, 
and I repeat to-day, that it was not."

"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that th
e truth is known."

"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that 
he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few
 details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips."

"For heaven's
 sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"

"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I r
eached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been a
n understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."

"My Mary? Impossible!
"

"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this m
an when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, a
n absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breat
hed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his hea
rt. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly eve
ry evening."

"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, w
hat occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and 
talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the 
snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he b
ent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes
 all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw y
ou coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with he
r wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
 he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread p
ass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage 
until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waite
d there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in 
the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the st
airs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see wha
t passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, an
d then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

"A
s long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. B
ut the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important i
t was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,
 and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but
 Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his oppon
ent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snappe
d, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room,
 and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when y
ou appeared upon the scene."

"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.

"You then roused his anger by calling him names a
t a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs with
out betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, 
however, and preserved her secret."

"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried Mr. 
Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear
 fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"

"Wh
en I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any tr
aces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had b
een a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and i
ndistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a m
an, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturb
ed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-l
eg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart,
 of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anythin
g more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex
 story was written in the snow in front of me.

"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second doub
le line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me
 that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was ma
rked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up
 and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the ot
her end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut u
p as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not
 mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hu
rt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to
 that clue.

"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window 
with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where
 the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurre
d. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had 
pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injurie
s which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of hi
s opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?

"It is
 an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the t
ruth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But i
f it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reaso
n. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so a
s the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted o
n seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.

"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover 
evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out li
ttle, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of 
him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the 
missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, fo
r the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.

"Well, your own good sense will suggest what mea
sures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his
 valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, mad
e all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly
 fitted the tracks."

"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.

"Precisely. It
 was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play 
then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see th
at our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave 
him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my m
an, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I to
ld him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief
 that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to g
et the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, a
nd after much chaffering I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was righ
t, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."

"A day which has
 saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you
 shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And
 now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poo
r Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"I think that we may safely s
ay," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sin
s are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment."

XII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES


"To th
e man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily T
elegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be der
ived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records o
f our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have g
iven prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to 
those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction
 and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province."

"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold m
yself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."

"You have erred, perhaps,
" he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was won
t to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempt
ing to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon rec
ord that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing."

"It seems 
to me that I have done you full justice in the matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egot
ism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.

"No, it is not self
ishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full justice 
for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore
 it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a cou
rse of lectures into a series of tales."

It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on ei
ther side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured
 houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
 and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes
 had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until
 at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literar
y shortcomings.

"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and 
gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you ha
ve been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The 
small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
 problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which 
are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."


"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest."

"Pshaw, my dea
r fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a composit
or by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I canno
t blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and ori
ginality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils a
nd giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This not
e I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.

It was dated 
from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:

"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as
 to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half
-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,


"VIOLET HUNTER."

"Do you know the young lady?
" I asked.

"Not I."

"It is half-past ten now."

"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."

"It may turn out to b
e of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere wh
im at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also."

"Well, let us hope so. But ou
r doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."

As he spoke the 
door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckle
d like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.

"You will 
excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange expe
rience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you wo
uld be kind enough to tell me what I should do."

"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything tha
t I can to serve you."

I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. 
He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips to
gether, to listen to her story.

"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of Colonel Spence
 Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over
 to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but wi
thout success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I 
should do.

"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and there I used to call
 about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the f
ounder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies wh
o are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and see
s whether she has anything which would suit them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office 
as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great h
eavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, lo
oking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to 
Miss Stoper.

" 'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite ent
husiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was
 quite a pleasure to look at him.

" 'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

" 'Yes, sir.'

" 'As governe
ss?'

" 'Yes, sir.'

" 'And what salary do you ask?'

" 'I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.
'

" 'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in 
a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?'

" 
'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawin
g--'

" 'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bear
ing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a chi
ld who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any 
gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commenc
e at $100 a year.'

"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too goo
d to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and t
ook out a note.

" 'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two
 little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand
, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'

"It seemed to me that I had never 
met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great conveni
ence, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more befo
re I quite committed myself.

" 'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.

" 'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Cop
per Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dea
rest old country-house.'

" 'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'

" 'One child--one dea
r little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack!
 Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.

"I was a l
ittle startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was jo
king.

" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'

" 'No, no, not the sole, not the s
ole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any litt
le commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You
 see no difficulty, heh?'

" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'

" 'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We a
re faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you w
ould not object to our little whim. Heh?'

" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.

" 'Or to sit here, 
or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'

" 'Oh, no.'

" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come t
o us?'

"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rath
er peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fa
shion.

" 'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes,
 and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.

" 'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is
 a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won
't cut your hair?'

" 'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.

" 'Ah, very well; then that quite settles th
e matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, 
I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.'

"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers wit
hout a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help sus
pecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.

" 'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the b
ooks?' she asked.

" 'If you please, Miss Stoper.'

" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the mo
st excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another 
such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the pag
e.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills
 upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had st
range fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccent
ricity. Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are
 improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had m
ade a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agen
cy and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it her
e and I will read it to you:


" 'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.

" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very ki
ndly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is 
very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give $
30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They
 are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear 
such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belon
ging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sit
ting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards you
r hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I 
am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for t
he loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with
 the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,


" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'

"That is the letter wh
ich I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before t
aking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."

"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mi
nd is made up, that settles the question," said Holmes, smiling.

"But you would not advise me to refuse?"

"I confes
s that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for."

"What is the meaning of it al
l, Mr. Holmes?"

"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"

"Well, there se
ems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possib
le that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, an
d that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"

"That is a possible solution--in fact, 
as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young la
dy."

"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"

"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me
 uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? There must be some strong rea
son behind."

"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. 
I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."

"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with
 you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months
. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--
"

"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"

Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could d
efine it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." 
She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in
 my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-mor
row." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said
 I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to ta
ke care of herself."

"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her
 before many days are past."

It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, 
during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human e
xperience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all point
ed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it w
as quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with
 knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. "Data
! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up by muttering
 that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.

The telegram which we eventually received came la
te one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical res
earches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and f
ind him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, g
lancing at the message, threw it across to me.

"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back to hi
s chemical studies.

The summons was a brief and urgent one.

"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at mid
day to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.


"HUNTER."

"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing
 up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my B
radshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."

"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analys
is of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning."

By eleven o'clock the next day we were well up
on our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we ha
d passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light
 blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very bright
ly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, 
away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid 
the light green of the new foliage.

"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fre
sh from the fogs of Baker Street.

But Holmes shook his head gravely.

"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is on
e of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subje
ct. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought w
hich comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."

"Good
 heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"

"They always fill me with a certain 
horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not prese
nt a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."

"You horrify me!"

"But the reaso
n is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane
 so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignati
on among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it
 going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fiel
ds, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelt
y, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who ap
peals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of coun
try which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."

"No. If she can come to Winch
ester to meet us she can get away."

"Quite so. She has her freedom."

"What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest
 no explanation?"

"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know
 them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find wai
ting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell."

T
he Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young l
ady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.

"I am so delighted that
 you have come," she said earnestly. "It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your
 advice will be altogether invaluable to me."

"Pray tell us what has happened to you."

"I will do so, and I must be
 quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, tho
ugh he little knew for what purpose."

"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long thin legs ou
t towards the fire and composed himself to listen.

"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, wit
h no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand th
em, and I am not easy in my mind about them."

"What can you not understand?"

"Their reasons for their conduct. But 
you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to
 the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large sq
uare block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round i
t, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past a
bout a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part
 of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name t
o the place.

"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening t
o his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your
 rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her
 husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation 
I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the 
first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had
 left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than 
twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.

"Mrs. Rucas
tle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
 She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son.
 Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if poss
ible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. An
d yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her
 face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her chil
d which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is sm
all for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an altern
ation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself
 seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little 
birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with
 my story."

"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or not."

"I sh
all try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was th
e appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a 
rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with the
m he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong wo
man with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortun
ately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the build
ing.

"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came d
own just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.

" 'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very m
uch obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has n
ot detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. 
You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be ex
tremely obliged.'

"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent mater
ial, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit 
if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite e
xaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching alo
ng the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close t
o the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up 
and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened t
o. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evid
ently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon he
r face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and t
hat I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.

"Two days later this same performance was gone t
hrough under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed 
very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then
 he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon th
e page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and the
n suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

"You can easily imagine, Mr.
 Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were a
lways very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to se
e what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror h
ad been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next oc
casion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to se
e all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impr
ession. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bea
rded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are us
ually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earn
estly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching
 gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was
 behind me. She rose at once.

" 'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares u
p at Miss Hunter.'

" 'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.

" 'No, I know no one in these parts.'

" 'Dear me
! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'

" 'Surely it would be better to take no not
ice.'

" 'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'

"I did a
s I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I ha
ve not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."

"Pray continue," said
 Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."

"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and 
there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I 
was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approac
hed it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.

" 'Look in here!' sai
d Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'

"I looked through and was conscious of t
wo glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.

" 'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughi
ng at the start which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is
 the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as ke
en as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodne
ss' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is wo
rth.'

"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clo
ck in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almos
t as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was mov
ing under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, a
s large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across 
the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do
 not think that any burglar could have done.

"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you kn
ow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the 
child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little thin
gs. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had fil
led the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use o
f the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys
 and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing 
in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.

"I took it up and examined it. 
It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upo
n me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the content
s, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. 
Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hai
r to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by op
ening a drawer which they had locked.

"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon ha
d a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited a
t all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariab
ly locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in hi
s hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustom
ed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. H
e locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.

"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a
 walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of 
the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. The
y were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me,
 looking as merry and jovial as ever.

" 'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, m
y dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.'

"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' s
aid I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'

"He looked sur
prised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.

" 'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I ha
ve made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed 
it? Who would have ever believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at m
e. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that ther
e was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere
 curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from m
y penetrating to this place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feelin
g. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.

"It was onl
y yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something 
to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recentl
y he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in t
he door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child 
was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slip
ped through.

"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at 
the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led 
into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that th
e evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been faste
ned one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with 
stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly 
with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkne
ss. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister do
or and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass
 backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning te
rror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as th
ough some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the doo
r, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.

" 'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then.
 I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.'

" 'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.

" 'My dear young lady! 
my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened you, my de
ar young lady?'

"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.


" 'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that
 I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'

" 'Only that?' said he, looking at me 
keenly.

" 'Why, what did you think?' I asked.

" 'Why do you think that I lock this door?'

" 'I am sure that I do n
ot know.'

" 'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the most amia
ble manner.

" 'I am sure if I had known--'

" 'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that thr
eshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a
 demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'

"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must ha
ve rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I t
hought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the m
an, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down al
l would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mi
nd was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half
 a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approach
ed the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility
 that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, o
r who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of 
seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before thre
e o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look afte
r the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what i
t all means, and, above all, what I should do."

Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My
 friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gra
vity upon his face.

"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.

"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do 
nothing with him."

"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"

"Yes."

"Is there a cellar with a good strong
 lock?"

"Yes, the wine-cellar."

"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensibl
e girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think
 you a quite exceptional woman."

"I will try. What is it?"

"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my 
friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs
. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon 
her, you would facilitate matters immensely."

"I will do it."

"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the af
fair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the rea
l person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the d
aughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, 
as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illnes
s through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon
 her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore
 the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from
 your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let 
loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious po
int in the case is the disposition of the child."

"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.

"My dear Wa
tson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents.
 Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character 
of parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and w
hether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor g
irl who is in their power."

"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A thousand things come ba
ck to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor cre
ature."

"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. 
At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery."

We were as good as our word
, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The gro
up of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to 
mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.

"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.


A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband l
ies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's."

"You have done well 
indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."

We 
passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade whi
ch Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in t
he lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.

"I trust that
 we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your sh
oulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."

It was an old rickety door and gave at once befor
e our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet be
d, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.

"There has been some
 villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off."

"Bu
t how?"

"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," h
e cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it."

"But it is impossible," s
aid Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away."

"He has come back and done it. I tell you 
that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon
 the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."

The words were hardly out 
of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand.
 Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confron
ted him.

"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"

The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open 
skylight.

"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? Y
ou are in my power. I'll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.

"He's gone for 
the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.

"I have my revolver," said I.

"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all 
rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a screa
m of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and sha
king limbs came staggering out at a side door.

"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been fed fo
r two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"

Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toll
er hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writ
hed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still
 meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly ma
ngled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the n
ews to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a 
tall, gaunt woman entered the room.

"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.

"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he c
ame back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would 
have told you that your pains were wasted."

"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs. Toller 
knows more about this matter than anyone else."

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."

"Then,
 pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.
"

"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got out from the cel
lar. If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that 
I was Miss Alice's friend too.

"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father marrie
d again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met
 Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so q
uiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He
 knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the l
aw would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whethe
r she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fe
ver, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful
 hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."

"Ah," 
said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can de
duce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"

"Yes, sir."

"And brought
 Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."

"That was it, sir.
"

"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succe
eded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his."

"Mr. 
Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.

"And in this way he managed that y
our good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone 
out."

"You have it, sir, just as it happened."

"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for yo
u have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I t
hink, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is 
rather a questionable one."

And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front o
f the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wif
e. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it diffic
ult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after th
eir flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter
, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be
 the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she 
has met with considerable success.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars fo
r each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected,
 entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected aud
ience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2

million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a tot
al of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's p
opulation then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenb
erg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,

PREFACE


As things now stand, the course of instruction in American hi
story in
our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.
Three separate books are used. First, 
there is the primary book, which
is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
anecdotes. Se
cond, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary 
book by the
addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high
school manual. This, too, ordinaril
y follows the beaten path, giving
fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we
do not ass
ume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians
 followed the
same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
multiplication table and fract
ions.

There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It
is that teachers have learned from bit
ter experience how little history
their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of
history wil
l deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing
methods of historical instruction. If the study of history 
cannot be
made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and
languages, then the historians assume a 
grave responsibility in adding
their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive
historical texts
 are only enlarged editions of the first text--more
facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the 
sharp
criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and
economics.

In this condition of affairs 
we find our justification for offering a
new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one
of o
mission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the
biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if
 pupils know
little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John
Smith by the time they reach the hig
h school, it is useless to tell the
same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It
is an offe
nse against the teachers of those subjects that are
demonstrated to be progressive in character.

In the next place w
e have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our
reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a singl
e
battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter
about which experts differ widely. In the 
field of military and naval
operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To
dispose of Gettysbur
g or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one w
ho
compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign
with the account given by Ropes, for instanc
e, will ask for no further
comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
of turning to a hig
h school manual for information about the art of
warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the
in
terest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that
deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very th
reshold of life's
serious responsibilities.

It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is

rather upon constructive features.

_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have
tried to se
t forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of
each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of ill
ustration.

_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to
explain how our nation has come to be 
what it is to-day.

_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
history, especially in r
elation to the politics of each period.

_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems
of fi
nancing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.
These are the subjects which belong to a history 
for civilians. These
are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must
understand, if they are to p
lay well their part in war and peace.

_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to
enlarge t
he treatment of our own time. We have given special attention
to the history of those current questions which must fo
rm the subject
matter of sound instruction in citizenship.

_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her
 unique
characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we
have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, w
orld relations, and the
reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.

_Seventh._ We have deliberately ai
med at standards of maturity. The
study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We
have aimed to 
stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,
reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge a
s well as
inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,
simple, and direct; but we have earnes
tly sought to stretch the
intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them
will receive the las
t of their formal instruction in the high school.
The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements w
ill
depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The
effectiveness of their citizenship in our repub
lic will be measured by
the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
information.

HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATE
S




PART I. THE COLONIAL PERIOD




CHAPTER I

THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA


The tide of migration that set in t
oward the shores of North America
during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
the restless
 and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every 
direction,
westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into
Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confi
nes of India. The Romans, supported
by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the
narrow lan
ds of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to
the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their h
ome beyond the
Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the
beginnings of modern Europe. 
Of this great sweep of races and empires
the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only
one 
aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the
institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends
 of the earth.

In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed
from that of the ancients. The G
reeks usually carried with them
affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
altar of the p
arent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to
America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mot
her
country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set
up altars of their own. They sought not o
nly new soil to till but also
political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.


THE AGENCIES OF AM
ERICAN COLONIZATION

It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of
water and found homes in
 the American wilderness at the opening of the
seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlay
s
of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
the life of the settlers until they could 
gather harvests of their own.
Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
the hazards of th
e new world. Soldiers were required for defense and
mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good ju
dgment,
adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an
enterprise demanded capital larger than the o
rdinary merchant or
gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
assume. Though in later d
ays, after initial tests had been made, wealthy
proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it 
was
the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
beginning.

=The Trading Company.=--English pion
eers in exploration found an
instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which
had long been em
ployed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.
Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different r
anks of
society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a
particular undertaking, each contribut
ing a sum of money and sharing in
the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it
received its
 charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from
the king and carried on its operations under his supervi
sion and
control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the
corporation and gave them certain powe
rs in the management of its
affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in
fact a little gover
nment set up by the king. When the members of the
corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Com
pany,
they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the
seas themselves and settled in America
, as in the case of Massachusetts,
they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The
stockholders 
in that instance became the voters and the governor, the
chief magistrate.

[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF
 THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY
COMPANY]

Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the
trading corporati
on. It was the London Company, created by King James I,
in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations 
of Virginia
at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,
chartered in 1621, that the Dutch pl
anted the settlements of the New
Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts
were Puritan l
eaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated
in 1629 under the title: "The governor and company of the 
Massachusetts
Bay in New England." In this case the law did but incorporate a group
drawn together by religious ties.
 "We must be knit together as one man,"
wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the
south,
 on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company
in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christ
ened New Sweden; it
was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the
rule of William Penn as t
he proprietary colony of Delaware.

In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the "company
colonies." It was,
 however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,
James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those im
prisoned
for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George
II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting s
everal gentlemen, including
himself, into "one body politic and corporate," known as the "Trustees
for establishing t
he colony of Georgia in America." In the structure of
their organization and their methods of government, the trustee
s did not
differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
colonization. Though their purposes were
 benevolent, their transactions
had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.

=The Religi
ous Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in
the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood,
 or
congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
religious faith. By one of the strange f
ortunes of history, this
institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a
potent force in the o
rigin and growth of self-government in a land far
away from Galilee. "And the multitude of them that believed were of
 one
heart and of one soul," we are told in the Acts describing the Church at
Jerusalem. "We are knit together as a b
ody in a most sacred covenant of
the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
care of each 
other's good and of the whole," wrote John Robinson, a
leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Ply
mouth in
1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a
written and signed agreement, incorpor
ating the spirit of obedience to
the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until
Plymouth was annex
ed to Massachusetts in 1691.

[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]

Three other colonies, all of which retained their 
identity until the eve
of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the
congregations of the faithful: R
hode Island, Connecticut, and New
Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by
small bodies o
f men and women, "united in solemn covenants with the
Lord," who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not unt
il many a
year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers
to the Narragansett country was Rho
de Island granted a charter of
incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation
of Thomas Hoo
ker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River
Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter 
of its own
(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the
towns laid out beyond the Merrima
c River by emigrants from Massachusetts
were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.

Even when Conn
ecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of
the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-g
overnment
and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The
towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethe
rsfield had long lived happily
under their "Fundamental Orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had
the settlers d
welt peacefully at New Haven under their "Fundamental
Articles" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connect
icut
shore had no difficulty in agreeing that "the Scriptures do hold forth a
perfect rule for the direction and gove
rnment of all men."

=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the
proprietor, or proprietary
. As the name, associated with the word
"property," implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king
granted pro
perty in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy
for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand 
the estate down
to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and
powerful person, prepared to furn
ish or secure the capital, collect the
ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found
and sus
tain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor
worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like 
partners in the
common undertaking.

Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,
owe their 
formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor
in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary sys
tem. Maryland,
established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and
blessed with religious toleration b
y the act of 1649, flourished under
the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American
union. New J
ersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley
and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government
 of the crown
in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the
generous spirit and tireless lab
ors of its first proprietor, the leader
of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
whose fam
ily it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first
organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and pat
ronage of
eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a
century both became royal provinces
 governed by the king.

THE COLONIAL PEOPLES

=The English
.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except
New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days
 of all, save
these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from
England. The colonists came from 
every walk of life. They were men,
women, and children of "all sorts and conditions." The major portion
were yeomen, 
or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With
them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of
 goods or
their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and
Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. 
Now and then the son of an
English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
America. The people r
epresented every religious faith--members of the
Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform th
at
church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;
and Catholics, who clung to the religion o
f their fathers.

New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and
1640, the period of arbitr
ary Stuart government, about twenty thousand
Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far
North
. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater
portion of the New England people sprang from thi
s original stock.
Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
England alone. Not until the eve
 of the Revolution did other
nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in
numbers.

The p
opulations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady st
ream of
immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from
the older settlements. New York was inv
aded by Puritans from New England
in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that
"free think
ing spreads almost as fast as the Church." North Carolina was
first settled toward the northern border by immigrants 
from Virginia.
Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the
way from New England, tarrying i
n Virginia only long enough to learn how
little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.

=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next 
to the English in numbers and influence were
the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both
relig
ious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch
ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in t
he north of Ireland
whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There
the Scotch nourished for 
many years enjoying in peace their own form of
religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
w
oolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth
century their religious worship was put under the 
ban and the export of
their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades
twenty thousand Scotch-
Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all
during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.
Alth
ough no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish
and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, c
omposed one-sixth of
the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.

[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERM
AN AND SCOTCH-IRISH
IMMIGRANTS]

These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Mar
yland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon
the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seab
oard
already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people
settling the interior and upland regions. 
There they cleared the land,
laid out their small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the soil,"
hardy, industriou
s, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the
luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
me
rchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen
manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of t
heir tireless
women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in
the colonies. Of their labors a po
et has sung:

        "O, willing hands to toil;
    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly
 soil;
    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field."

=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in o
rder of numerical
importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in
colonial records. A number o
f the artisans and carpenters in the first
Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous
governor
 of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and
Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the
 provincial
administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The
wholesale migration of Germans began
 with the founding of Pennsylvania.
Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
lands and he 
made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine
country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company
, bought
more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
center at Germantown for the distribution
 of German immigrants. In old
New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for
distribution. All the way
 from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered
to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in

time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that
German princes were frightened at the loss of s
o many subjects and
England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
dominions. Yet nothing could st
op the movement. By the end of the
colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two
hundred thousand
.

The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South
Germany. Wars, religious controversies, opp
ression, and poverty drove
them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also
among them skille
d artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mi
lls,
dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the
wealth and independence of the province.

A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]

Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak 
the language of the
original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,
built their own schools, 
founded their own newspapers, and published
their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
an
d led to occasional agitations against "foreigners." However, no
serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the
 days of the
Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot
armies side by side with soldiers fr
om the English and Scotch-Irish
sections.

=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the
Germ
ans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other
racial strains as well, varying in numerical import
ance but contributing
their share to colonial life.

From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the ki
ng which
inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.

From "Old Ireland" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in
 race and
Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,
they revered neither the government n
or the church of England imposed
upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping
records of the co
lonial period show that boatload after boatload left
the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.
Un
doubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native
stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constan
t appearance of
Celtic names in the records of various colonies.

The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious
and economic to
leration, found in the American colonies, not complete
liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in Engla
nd,
France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize
their right to live in any of the dominion
s, but owing to the easy-going
habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
towns. The treat
ment they received there varied. On one occasion the
mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and
 on
another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,
Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospi
table, and there large
Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,
flourished in spite o
f nominal prohibitions of the law.

Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged
beneath the tid
e of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued
to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the Eng
lish
conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the
170,000 inhabitants of the province wer
e descendants of the original
Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
manners of New York
. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch o
vens;
but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in
beside them to farm and trade.

The meltin
g pot had begun its historic mission.


THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION

Considered from one side, colonization, whatever
 the motives of the
emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay
for their passage, to su
stain them on the voyage, and to start them on
the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,

Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.

=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to Amer
ica
in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,
and paid their own passage. What proport
ion of the colonists were able
to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.
Undoubtedly a v
ery considerable number could do so, for we can trace the
family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge i
s authority
for the statement that "the settlers of New England were drawn from the
country gentlemen, small farmers,
 and yeomanry of the mother
country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists
show, and all of t
hem, with few exceptions, were men of property and
good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigr
ation
is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left
behind." Though it would be interesting 
to know how accurate this
statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as
yet been made to grat
ify that interest. For the present it is an
unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
cos
t of their own transfer to the New World.

=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants
were
 unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
a doubt by the shipping records that have come d
own to us. The great
barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost
of the sea voyage. To ov
ercome this difficulty a plan was worked out
whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
mone
y to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a
term of years to repay the sum advanced. This sys
tem was called
indentured servitude.

It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
twenty th
ousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the
Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Mass
achusetts to
Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
women, and children serving out te
rms of bondage generally ranging from
five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
servant
s was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other
promoters anxiously sought for workers of every national
ity to till
their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
moon. Hence the gates of the prop
rietary colonies were flung wide open.
Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,
and spec
ial efforts were made to increase the population by importing
servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find 
a master with
fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds
of all the immigrants into Pen
nsylvania between the opening of the
eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.
In the ot
her Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but
it formed a considerable part of the population.

The 
story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed 
from the serfs of the
feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.
They likewise differed fr
om the negro slaves in that their servitude had
a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. I
t
was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far
heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the
 same offense. A free
citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
let off with a fine; a wh
ite servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
was whipped at the post and fined as well.

The ordinary life of the 
white servant was also severely restricted. A
bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in
tra
de; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or
indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of se
rvice was extended.
The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, "was
little better than that of s
laves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put
them at the mercy of their masters." It would not be unfair to add that
su
ch was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the
temper of their masters.

Cruel as was the syste
m in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the
Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle wit
h fate
for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude
were over, if they survived, they mig
ht obtain land of their own or
settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble
proved to be a lo
sing venture because he found himself unable to rise
out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servit
ude
carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real
avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some o
f the best citizens of America
have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.

=The Transported--Involuntary S
ervitude.=--In their anxiety to secure
settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America
either reso
rted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,
and children from the streets of English cities. In 168
0 it was
officially estimated that "ten thousand persons were spirited away" to
America. Many of the victims of the p
ractice were young children, for
the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were
sometimes dis
posed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.
In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children we
re shipped to
Virginia.

In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few
romances. Parents were s
eparated from their children and husbands from
their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and
wea
vers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus
dragged off to the New World to be sold into servit
ude for a term of
five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
fortunes. In one case a young ma
n who was forcibly carried over the sea
lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a
peerage.


Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts
deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fine
s and imprisonment. The
Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.
Indeed, they exaggera
ted its evils, for many of the "criminals" were
only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant
ca
ught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl
who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded 
as a criminal along with
sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders
were "political crimina
ls"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed
the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against
Br
itish rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against
the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, d
ispatched after the
monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who
joined in political uprisin
gs against the king.

=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
indentured servants and 
whites carried to America against their will
were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When

this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was
looked upon as a temporary necessity to be di
scarded with the increase
of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters
who first bought n
egroes at the auction block intended to establish a
system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel s
lavery
take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
supply. In 1650, thirty years after th
e introduction of slavery, there
were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.

The great increase in later years was
 due in no small measure to the
inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in
New England.
 Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,
they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The Engl
ish Royal
African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
to ten thousand slaves. The ship o
wners of New England were not far
behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.

As the propor
tion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and sl
ave traders,
the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail
the importation by placing a dut
y of $5 on each slave. This effort was
futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time
similar b
ills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South
Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; bu
t the measure
was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted
by a century of rebuffs, sent t
o George III a petition in this vein:
"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa
hath long
 been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear,
 will endanger
the very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply
impressed with these sentiments, we
 most humbly beseech Your Majesty to
remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony
which inh
ibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerce."

All such protests were without avai
l. The negro population grew by leaps
and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than
half a 
million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,
and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually e
xceeded the whites
in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the
population. Even in the Middle c
olonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania
about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the
proportio
n of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York
 approximately one
in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few
freedmen.

The climate, the s
oil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were
all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, s
lavery,
though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern
ships carried slaves to the Southern
 colonies and the produce of the
plantations to Europe. "If the Northern states will consult their
interest, they wil
l not oppose the increase in slaves which will
increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers," said

John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the
Constitution of the United States. "What enrich
es a part enriches the
whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,"
responded Oliver Ellsw
orth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.

CHAPTER II

COLONI
AL AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, AND COMMERCE

THE LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT


=The Significance of Land Tenure.=--The 
way in which land may be
acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
deep influence on the l
ife and culture of a people. The feudal and
aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism

which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,
the land was nearly all held in great estates, 
each owned by a single
proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the
law of primogeniture, 
which at the death of a lord transferred all his
landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of

estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
owning their own land. It made a form of tena
ntry or servitude
inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also
enabled the landlords to maintain
 themselves in power as a governing
class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
political c
ontrol. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was
equally important in the development of America, where pr
actically all
the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
livelihood from the soil.

=Experimen
ts in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad
extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossi
ble to
introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
and tenants that existed across the sea.
 So it happened that almost
every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,
was tried. In the e
arly days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though
owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers
. No
man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:
"Labor and share alike." All were supposed t
o work in the fields and
receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims
attempted a similar experim
ent, laying out the fields in common and
distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
the 
workers.

In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the
lazy men in Jamestown who idled th
eir time away and yet expected regular
meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: "Everyone that gathereth
not eve
ry day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the
river and forever banished from the fort and live there 
or starve." Even
this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until
each man was given a plot of hi
s own to till, not until each gathered
the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where
the co
mmunal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar
to those in Virginia, and the system was given up f
or one of separate
fields in which every person could "set corn for his own particular."
Some other New England towns
, refusing to profit by the experience of
their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and
lab
or, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
the land. "By degrees it was seen that even the Lo
rd's people could not
carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
practice."

=Feudal Elem
ents in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and
Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements o
f
land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions
of the South, and to some extent in New York
. The proprietor was in fact
a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He
could retain any
 part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an 
estate of
baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any
considerable part of the land in his
 dominion. Consequently he either
sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
condition that the
y make to him an annual payment in money, known as
"quit rent." In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as hi
gh as
$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this
source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents broug
ht a handsome annual
tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,
the king of England claim
ed all revenues collected in this form from the
land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The q
uit
rent,--"really a feudal payment from freeholders,"--was thus a material
source of income for the crown as well as
 for the proprietors. Wherever
it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant
irritation; and i
t became a formidable item in the long list of
grievances which led to the American Revolution.

Something still more
 like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in
the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the cr
own, the
companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there
were sixty manors of three thousand acr
es each, owned by wealthy men and
tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
tenure. In New 
York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of
which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company
, when
extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van
 Cortlandt, and the Livingston
manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
representative to t
he provincial legislature. The tenants on the New
York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old Euro
pean
estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they
ground their grain at his mill; and the
y were subject to his judicial
power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances
extending to capi
tal punishment.

The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence
as compared with the vast pl
antations of the Southern seaboard--huge
estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by
slav
es more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten
that this system of land tenure became the dominant
 feature of a large
section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
America.

[Illustration: SO
UTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]

=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and
throughout most o
f the North, the drift was against all forms of
servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,

the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
family. This was favored by natural circumstances 
and the spirit of the
immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
labor made it impossible f
or the companies, the proprietors, or the
crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In
man
y sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,
the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to 
keep the farms within a
moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and
German peasants, even if 
they had been tenants in the Old World, did not
propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If the
y
could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced
proprietors and companies to bid for their 
enterprise by selling land in
small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
became the cherished
 unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the
farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the f
reehold
system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.

[Illustration: _From an old print_


A NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]

=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western
settlement thus d
eveloped two distinct types of people engaged in the
same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they bo
th
cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
which arise from that occupation. Their meth
ods and their culture,
however, differed widely.

The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resemble
d the
English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
labored with his own hands in the fiel
ds and forests. He sold his rice
and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his
entire crop i
n exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,
silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving 
the
ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford
or Cambridge for their education. In sho
rt, he depended very largely for
his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
Old World. He
 did not even need market towns in which to buy native
goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own art
isans who
were usually gifted slaves.

The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His
crops we
re not big enough to warrant direct connection with English
factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisan
s. He needed
local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,
weavers, wagon-makers, and potters 
at neighboring towns supplied him
with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought
by the rich 
planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not
buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and suga
r, and
between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community
was therefore more self-sufficient than 
the seaboard line of great
plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,
more American. The p
lanter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New
West.

=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless 
were alike in
one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of
an expert for new and fertile so
il; and so, north and south, as soon as
a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration
set in
 westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over
mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search
 for cheap
lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path
breakers to the West were native A
mericans of the second and third
generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the
mysterious unknown, a
nd hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following
their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending 
back
stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular
settlers with lawful titles to the lands they h
ad purchased, sometimes
singly and sometimes in companies.

In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in th
e founding of
Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the
eighteenth century the pioneers
 of Connecticut had pushed north and west
until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New
Yo
rk, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,
and from that old Dutch center it radiated in eve
ry direction,
particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early
filled to its borders, the beginn
ings of the present city of New
Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In
Pennsylvania, as in New
 York, the waterways determined the main lines of
advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,

spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying
out Reading in 1748. Another current of migrat
ion was directed by the
Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
where Harrisburg was lat
er founded. Along the southern tier of counties
a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching

the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn
family.

In the South the westward march was 
equally swift. The seaboard was
quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
cultivation of tob
acco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from
the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two s
treams
of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
other colonies--Germans from Pennsylv
ania and Scotch-Irish furnishing
the main supply. "By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing
and the 'back
 country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully
occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by stur
dy pioneers.
Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of
home-seekers had reached the crest of the A
lleghanies."

[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]

Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, h
arbingers of an
invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As
early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod,
 Daniel Boone, curious to hunt
buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the
Cumberland Gap and 
brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, s
ettlers
followed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the
Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant 
adventurers of earlier
times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
rents from lands sold to f
armers. By the outbreak of the Revolution
there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older
co
lonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked
the Transylvania Company. They even carried the
ir protests into the
Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
fourteenth colony."


INDUS
TRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was
a steady g
rowth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the
staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles,
 have their
beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
towns which enjoyed an importance
 all out of proportion to their
numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
originated in the 
days when the king of England was "lord of these
dominions."

[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLE
S]

=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in
addition to sharing every hardship of pioneerin
g, often the heavy labor
of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry
which was almost excl
usively their own. Wool and flax were raised in
abundance in the North and South. "Every farm house," says Coman, the

economic historian, "was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which ser
ved for the common wear."
By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth
in sufficient quant
ities to export it to the Southern colonies and to
the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for
 the
more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and
spinning continued to be done in the hom
e. The Dutch of New Netherland,
the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior "were not
one whit behin
d their Yankee neighbors."

The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be
overestimated. F
or many a century the English had employed their fine
woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, 
and the
government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
protection. When the colonies were e
stablished, both merchants and
statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;
but before lo
ng the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of
the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place 
of
customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon
English markets, here was the germ of economic
 independence.

If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
trade, observant officers in the
 provinces would have conveyed the news
to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
governor
 of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home
government: "The consequence will be that if they can clo
the themselves
once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of
England, they who already are not 
very fond of submitting to government
will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
in the
ir breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort
of people this country is inhabited by."

=The Iro
n Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron
working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colo
nial
industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within
fifteen years after the founding of Bos
ton. The smelting of iron began
at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,
Connecticut, a few year
s later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in
1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey h
ad
iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the va
lleys of the Delaware and
the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then
laid the foundations 
of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in
 the
year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon
lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in t
he eighteenth century.
Governor Spotswood was called the "Tubal Cain" of the Old Dominion
because he placed the indus
try on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems
that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,
metal
lic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large
quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, enco
uraged the
colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.

=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries
 in the colonies,
shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak
for timbers and boards, pi
tch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope
made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century 
a
ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century
shipyards were scattered along the New England c
oast at Newburyport,
Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.
Yards at Albany and Poughkee
psie in New York built ships for the trade
of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia
so
on entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal
the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Vi
rginia, and South
Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the
lucrative business of produ
cing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and
tar.

=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England out
side
of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy
sailors from Europe, long before the landing o
f the Pilgrims, flourished
under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the
net and the harpoon
 in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. "Look,"
exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, "at the manner in

which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale
fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling m
ountains of ice and
behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay
and Davis's Straits, whi
le we are looking for them beneath the arctic
circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of pola
r
cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial h
eat more discouraging
to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst
some of them draw the l
ine and strike the harpoon on the coast of
Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
the 
coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No
climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither 
the perseverance of
Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
of English enterprise ever
 carried this most perilous mode of hard
industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
people."


The influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative
European trade was built upon it. The better qual
ity of the fish caught
for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or
exchanged for salt, lemons,
 and raisins for the American market. The
lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave
consumption,
 and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished
the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New En
gland. These
activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
demand for fishing and merchant cra
ft of every kind and thus keeping the
shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport
towns rush
ed with work. They also increased trade with the mother
country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of
 Europe and
the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an
ever-widening circle of American ente
rprise centered around this single
industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.

=Oceanic Commerce an
d American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth
century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every dir
ection
until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,
and the profits gleaned, the commerce 
of European nations. A modern
historian has said: "The enterprising merchants of New England developed
a network of t
rade routes that covered well-nigh half the world." This
commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflic
t with the
mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.

On the one side, it involved the export of raw 
materials and
agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,
tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine;
 the Middle colonies, grain, flour,
furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,
and smal
l articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact
astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the 
idea of an
American union, once remarked of colonial trade: "What sort of dish will
you make? New England will throw 
in fish and onions. The middle states,
flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North
Carolina, p
itch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,
and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawd
ust. Such an
absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
discordant materials as the thirte
en British provinces."

On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,
consisting principally of Eng
lish and continental manufactures, tea, and
"India goods." Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,
supplied
 the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to 
the Southern
colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of
pounds of her capital.

The disposit
ion of imported goods in the colonies, though in part
controlled by English factors located in America, employed also
 a large
and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises
of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancock
s, and Faneuils of Boston; and the
Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they
were worthy r
ivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for
world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the adv
antages
they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British
navy, the American merchants were hig
h-spirited and mettlesome, ready to
contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests
against outside
 interference.

[Illustration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM
(NEW YORK CITY)]

Measured against the
 immense business of modern times, colonial commerce
seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its
sig
nificance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English
colonial trade in its entirety--a relation whic
h can be shown by a few
startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to
the colonies, was, in
 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American
Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies
a
lone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the
whole foreign business of England two generations 
before. At the first
date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;
at the second date, it 
was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,
Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; 
in
1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,
Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times w
ithin sixty-eight years,
amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the
colonies at the openin
g of the century. The American colonies were
indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.

=Intercolonial Co
mmerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made
overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers
 and
harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the
colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware
, and Susquehanna rivers in
the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for
goods to be broug
ht from, and carried to, the interior regions in little
sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manu
factures,
domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,
or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts
, visited small ports, and sailed up
the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
the raw 
materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.
Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and h
ardware of New
England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,
leather, tar, and ship timber. F
rom the harbors along the Connecticut
shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to
Maryland,
 Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.

=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry
there 
grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
which were soon reckoned among the first commercial
 towns of the whole
British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
ports as Liverpool and Bristo
l. The statistical records of that time are
mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among
t
hese towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and western Jersey, it had drawn within its bord
ers, just before the
Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with
somewhat more than 20,000 
people. New York, the "commercial capital of
Connecticut and old East Jersey," was slightly smaller than Boston, but

growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South
Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newp
ort in Rhode Island, a
center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
of about 7000. Baltimor
e and Norfolk were counted as "considerable
towns." In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in
P
ennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and
increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America
 away from the
seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,
Virginia, for example, had about two
 hundred houses, in which dwelt a
dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county
seats ofte
n consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,
and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litig
ants during the
sessions of the court.

The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
propo
rtion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one
thing; of the press and political activity, for a
nother. Merchants and
artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
from their commercial 
operations. The towns were also centers for news,
gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the mar
ket
places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and
laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen,
 were drawn into the main
currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
independence.

Chapter III

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS


Colonial life, crowded as it was with h
ard and unremitting toil, left
scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. There was
little money in 
private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to r
ead long
and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
delight the eye and the mind. And ye
t, poor and meager as the
intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic
efforts were made 
in every community to lift the people above the plane
of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the
 forests
those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the
thought and spirit of the land. The a
ppearance, during the struggle with
England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,
political ph
ilosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy
itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the Am
erican
intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the
writings of distinguished Americans scatter
ed from Massachusetts to
Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,
Hamilton, Franklin, Washingt
on, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,
and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was
somet
hing in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties th
an the men in the
process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is
evident in many a record lik
e the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her
husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,
the 
sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British
propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and man
aged by women.


THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES

In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of 
high
importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the
colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Engla
nd--the religious impulse
had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all
the colonies, the 
clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only
class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They pr
eached
on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of
local problems and in the formation o
f political opinion, so much of
which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They
wrote books and 
pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the
colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the
A
mericans received their formal education. In several of the provinces
the Anglican Church was established by law. In 
New England the Puritans
were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
authority. In the M
iddle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of
sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; a
nd in
all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in
time a separation of church and state and
 freedom of opinion.

=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English
system of church and state
. The Anglican faith and worship were
prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the
govern
or, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. "The
Established Church," says Lodge, "was one of the append
ages of the
Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,
and the parish church stood not inf
requently on the estate of the
planter who built and managed it." As in England, Catholics and
Protestant Dissenters 
were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only
slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but wh
en
once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,
by the Revolution, they outnumbered the a
dherents of the established
order.

The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
Carolinas aft
er 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly
under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the
 majority of
the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics
it was likewise established in Ma
ryland. In New York, too,
notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was
fostered by the pro
vincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about
one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out o
f
proportion to their numbers.

Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the
colonies. It wa
s supported by the British government and the official
class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops i
n England
were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by
acts of Parliament. Having its seat
 of power in the English monarchy, it
could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
counteract to 
some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, 
therefore had
a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing
leaders firmly grasped this fa
ct about the middle of the eighteenth
century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
Church in p
rovincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to
calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dis
senting
Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
in the mother country.

=Puritanism i
n New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial
unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plym
outh Pilgrims
had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a
separate and independent congregat
ion before they came to America. The
Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,
soon after 
their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke
of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate co
ngregation was
organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
other officers. They also compo
sed the voters in the town meeting, where
secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was
thu
s complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for
 local autonomy
instead of imperial unity.

The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and
t
heir fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for
the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather ha
ving three hundred and
eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the
civil officers they en
forced a strict observance of the Puritan
Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and
la
sted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and
all worldly conversation were absolutely prohi
bited during those hours.
A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
was in danger of be
ing banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout
Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horse
back
one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
him through a rift in the clouds. The n
ext day he was brought into court
and fined for "his ungodly conduct." With persons accused of witchcraft
the Puritan
s were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept
over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged
, one was pressed
to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.

Just about this time, however, there c
ame a break in the uniformity of
Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it
with disfavor,
 and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of
the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven y
ears later
wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
governor and reserved the power of ap
pointment to the king. It also
abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting
for it a simp
le property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an
official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and mona
rchist in
sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious
denominations, if they had the req
uired amount of property, were
permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the
crown, the Puritan
 monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that
province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, a
nd New
Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the
suffrage.

=Growth of Religious Toleratio
n.=--Though neither the Anglicans of
Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for
other deno
minations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode
Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, libert
y in
matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by
granting in 1649 freedom to those who profe
ssed to believe in Jesus
Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to
the tenets of the Frie
nds, gave freedom of conscience to those "who
confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the
crea
tor, upholder, and ruler of the World." By one circumstance or
another, the Middle colonies were thus early character
ized by diversity
rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,
Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, 
New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,
Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
too widely sc
attered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had
desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sectio
ns where
one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature
steadily controlled by a single group. T
oleration encouraged diversity,
and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.

The government and faith of t
he dissenting denominations conspired with
economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English
st
ate. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy
of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the s
eat of power in London.
Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
articles of faith. Loca
l self-government in matters ecclesiastical
helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The

spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,
nourished as it was amid favorable circumstan
ces in the New World, made
them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
authority imposed from wit
hout.


SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant
denomination w
as the education of the children in the faith. In this
work the Bible became the center of interest. The English vers
ion was
indeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
whose life had once been bounded by th
e daily routine of labor, found in
the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a
book of ro
mance, travel, and history. "Legend and annal," says John
Richard Green, "war-song and psalm, state-roll and biograph
y, the mighty
voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission
journeys, of perils by sea and amon
g the heathen, philosophic arguments,
apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
the mos
t part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the
English version of the Bible remains the noblest ex
ample of the English
tongue." It was the King James version just from the press that the
Pilgrims brought across the 
sea with them.

For the authority of the Established Church was substituted the
authority of the Scriptures. The Puri
tans devised a catechism based upon
their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in
America,
 they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
in seeing that their children and wards were taught 
to read religious
works and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was
scarcely twenty years old befo
re education of this character was
declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools
where those n
ot taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
writing.

Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not r
egarded
with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
little schools kept by "dames, itinerant
 teachers, or local parsons."
Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in
the South, we rea
d of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes
girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,

fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
of learning. Though illiteracy was widesprea
d, there is evidence to show
that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
progress all through 
the eighteenth century.

=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the
establishment of college
s as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in
1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train
"lea
rned and godly ministers" for the Puritan churches of New England.
To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, wa
s designed first as a
mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England
farmers preparing to p
reach, teach, or practice law. The College of New
Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years lat
er,
was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the
Established Church as their source of inspiration 
and support: William
and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia
University, chartered by
 King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the
New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the

"republican tendencies" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away
from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhod
e Island in 1764, and the
Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,
organized by Benjamin F
ranklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by
giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
se
cts. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men
to serve in public office as leaders of the peo
ple and ornaments to
their country.

=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of
learning, 
higher education was by no means confined within their walls.
Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or C
ambridge in
England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families
there were intelligent children 
who grew up in the great colonial school
of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind
and 
wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or
any other college. Such, for example, was Benjami
n Franklin, whose
charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a
fine record of self-educatio
n. His formal training in the classroom was
limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his
self-educatio
n continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal
for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry 
library on
theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's
_On the Human Understanding_, and 
innumerable volumes dealing with
secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,
Franklin acquire
d by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read wide
ly
in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of
European savants for his discoveries in el
ectricity. By his own efforts
he "attained an acquaintance" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,
thus unconsciou
sly preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
for all America at the court of the king of France.

Lesser li
ghts than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found
all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of 
native ability,
self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of
the Revolution.


THE COLONIAL
 PRESS

=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a
government by public opinion, enligh
tened by the open discussion of
political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That
too, like ed
ucation, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was
brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge
 of an
official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty
years elapsed before the first newspa
per appeared, bearing the curious
title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not
been running 
very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed
it for discussing a political question.

Publishing, inde
ed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704
there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Lette
r_,
which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
criticizing the authorities. Still the pub
lic interest languished. When
Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_
about 1720, his fri
ends sought to dissuade him, saying that one
newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his

confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette
or chronicle appeared within the next thirty 
years or more. Benjamin
Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five
newspapers. Boston led with 
five. Philadelphia had three: two in English
and one in German.

=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea 
of printing,
unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,
however, slow in taking form. The foun
ders of the American colonies had
never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,
pamphlets, 
broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was
first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in cl
erical
authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in
the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of t
he press became a part of royal
prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;
and no one cou
ld publish anything without previous approval of the
official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular pa
rty,
with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence
royalist and clerical writers by a vigo
rous censorship. After the
restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed
in royal hands, whe
re it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by
failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the officia
l

censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so
active and printing presses were so numerous th
at official review of all
published matter became a sheer impossibility.

In America, likewise, some troublesome ques
tions arose in connection
with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less
anxious than King Cha
rles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from
the prying eyes of the people all literature "not mete for them to

read"; and so they established a system of official licensing for
presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colo
nies where there was
more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
impunity, they were never
theless constantly liable to arrest for
printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the
editor
 of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the
proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political 
article,
and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.
A still more famous case was that of
 Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,
who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who
venture
d to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
practice, and it became necessary to bring an attor
ney all the way from
Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the
approbation of the public wa
s forthcoming when the lawyer for the
defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not
that o
f the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it
finally came, was the signal for an outburst of pop
ular rejoicing.
Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing
is the freedom of the press.


Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the
vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps
 nearly one-half, of
the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
almanacs that streamed from the
 types, the people could follow the
course of public events and grasp the significance of political
arguments. An Ame
rican opinion was in the process of making--an
independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions

around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to
British rule came, government by opinion was a
t hand. For every person
who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a
thousand who could 
see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had
spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richa
rd's
Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.


THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS

Two ver
y distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.
The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privil
eges, was the
drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
England. The other, leading towa
rd democracy and self-government, was
the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each
movement gave
 impetus to the other, with increasing force during the
passing years, until at last the final collision between the 
two ideals
of government came in the war of independence.

=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies e
ight were
royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia
passed under the direct rule of the
 crown in 1624, when the charter of
the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost
its chart
er in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later
stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chie
f executive. In
the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were
given the provincial instead of t
he proprietary form. New Hampshire,
severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the
trustees in 1
752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,
transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 166
4,
became a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New
Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years u
nder proprietors, was
brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
Delaware, although they re
tained their proprietary character until the
Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their
gov
ernors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island a
nd Connecticut,
retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone
had governors and legislatures
 entirely of their own choosing.

The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed
high and impo
rtant powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent o
f a council,
appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and
reprieves; he was head of the highest 
court; he was commander-in-chief
of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
time of inv
asion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except
Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper
 house of
the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.
He summoned, adjourned, and dissolve
d the popular assembly, or the lower
house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and
he vetoed
 measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America
all the elements of royal prerogative against which Ha
mpden had
protested and Cromwell had battled in England.

[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]

T
he colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them
 were noblemen
of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The
pretensions of this circle gr
ated on colonial nerves, and privileges
granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen
popula
r antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to
adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. 
The
reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which
they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wra
th against that combination.

=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward
administration through royal
 governors was the second and opposite
tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.
The vote
rs of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
law-making through representatives in Parliament, and
 the idea was early
introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
its first representative as
sembly appeared. As the towns of
Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
the corpora
tion to meet at one place, the representative idea was
adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a repr
esentative
system under their "Fundamental Orders" of 1639, and the entire colony
was given a royal charter in 1662. 
Generosity, as well as practical
considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William
Penn to invit
e their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process o
r another every
one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.

It is true that in the provision for popular electio
ns, the suffrage was
finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
toward the freehold qualifica
tion. In Virginia, the rural voter had to
be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no
house 
on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.
In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assem
bly under the charter
of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
at least or of other p
roperty to the value of forty pounds sterling. In
Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty 
acres
or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons
worth at least fifty pounds in lawful m
oney.

Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
considerable number of men, particularly
 the mechanics and artisans of
the towns, who were by no means content with their position.
Nevertheless, it was rela
tively easy for any man to acquire a small
freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion
o
f the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the
limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.


The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
in battles with the royal and proprietary g
overnors. When called upon by
the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,
the legislature 
took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, gran
ts of
money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists l
earned some of the
mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious
officials. The legislature als
o used its power over money grants to
force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.

=Contes
ts between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many
and bitter were the contests between the royal and 
proprietary governors
and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how
the Pennsylvania assembly
 held in one hand a bill for the executive to
sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sl
y
humor, Franklin adds: "Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our
proprietary constitution for these our bargain 
and sale proceedings in
legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own
before can be had for 
ready money. It is another addition to the value
of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not s
o
blessed."

It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily
as Franklin's tale implies. On th
e contrary, the legislatures, like
Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
executive 
prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If
we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the cro
wn in America
was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the
friends of the governor complained
 in 1747 that "the inhabitants of
plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon
republican princi
ples all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of
royal authority remains in the Northern colonies." "Here," echoed
 the
governor of South Carolina, the following year, "levelling principles
prevail; the frame of the civil government
 is unhinged; a governor, if
he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their
whole administrat
ion in their hands; the election of the members of the
assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesias
tical
preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people."

Though baffled by the "levelling principles" of t
he colonial assemblies,
the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved
a system of policy a
nd action which they thought could bring the
obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters

to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal
officers in the colonies were to be made indepen
dent of the legislatures
by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was
to be maintained in 
America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to
be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be en
larged.

Such a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many
ministers of the crown in London. With 
governors, courts, and an army
independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry
out both royal o
rders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both
practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it 
came fresh
from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It
failed to take account of the fact t
hat the American people were growing
strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the
tutelage o
f the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or
how benevolent its intentions.

CHAPTER IV

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM


It is one of the well-known facts o
f history that a people loosely
united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a
people torn by dom
estic strife, may be welded into a solid and compact
body by an attack from a foreign power. The imperative call to c
ommon
defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common
service--these things, induced by the 
necessity of resisting outside
interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,
perhaps, the mo
st discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most
virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. "Politics," runs
 an old
saying, "stops at the water's edge."

This ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic
circ
les, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American
colonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity f
or common
defense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it
has long been the practice to speak
 of the early settlements as founded
in "a wilderness," this was not actually the case. From the earliest
days of Jam
estown on through the years, the American people were
confronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settle
ments
were Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
as sharp conflicts over land aroused a
ngry passions. To the south and
west was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to
the Armada, b
ut still presenting an imposing front to the British
empire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energe
tic,
imperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the
advance of British dominion in America.


RELA
TIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH

=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the
relati
ons of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in
different shape in different sections of America. I
t was not handled
according to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,
which alone could speak for al
l the provinces at the same time. Neither
did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an
irre
gular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience
necessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. A
s the difficulties
arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
were making their way with 
gun and ax, nearly everything that happened
was the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel
b
etween traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the
exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery,
 or a flash of bad temper
often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.

On one side of the 
ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of
Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; o
f
Roger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William
Penn treating with them on his arrival in 
America. On the other side of
the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
frontier rolled wes
tward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the
Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlement
s
with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A
generation later, King Philip, son of Mass
asoit, the friend of the
Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
the strength of all N
ew England to the field and ended in his own
destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially
wit
h the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and
desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suf
fered as did New
England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the
Jamestown settlers, launched a 
general massacre; and in 1644 he
attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.
Nathaniel B
acon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself 
headed a revolt
and a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia
outposts advanced into the Kentucky 
country, the strife with the natives
was transferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to the
southeast, a desp
erate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the
combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.

[Illustration

VIRGINIANS DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INDIANS]

From such horrors New Jersey and Delawa
re were saved on account of their
geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of
conciliatio
n, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia
, by clever
negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms
with her belligerent Cherokees and C
reeks. But neither diplomacy nor
generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,
especially a
fter the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their
imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting beca
me general
warfare.

[Illustration: ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,
1750]

=Early Relations with
 the French.=--During the first decades of French
exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English

colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought
to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded i
n 1608, and Montreal, in
1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in
strength to be much of a
 menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was
the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in
Am
erica, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
empires in North America. It was the ambition of L
ouis XIV of France,
rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that
sounded the first note of 
colonial alarm.

Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
English and the French occurred b
efore their advancing frontiers met on
the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's
War (170
1-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins
and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries
 of European
powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles
with the French and their savage a
llies.

=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly
closed, however, before the English colo
nists themselves began to be
seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the
West. Marquette and
 Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,
who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been fo
llowed
by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus
taking possession of the gateway to th
e Mississippi as well as the St.
Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they
occupied Crown Poi
nt; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion
over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted 
this
lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, F
ort Venango on the upper
waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the
streams forming the Ohio. 
Though they were warned by George Washington,
in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory "so
n
otoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain," the
French showed no signs of relinquishing their pre
tensions.

BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]

=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Th
us it happened that the
shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French
and Indian War, was fi
red in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the
conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved
E
ngland and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and
minor powers on the other. On American soil, the
 defeat of Braddock in
1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the
dramatic features. On t
he continent of Europe, England subsidized
Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the
Ganges,
 as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were
triumphant. Well could the historian write: "Conquests equali
ng in
rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had
been achieved in the East." Well could
 the merchants of London declare
that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of
this world-wid
e conflict, commerce had been "united with and made to
flourish by war."

From the point of view of the British empir
e, the results of the war
were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of
the Mississippi, exc
ept New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The
remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and
 French
imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In
exchange for Havana, which the British had
 seized during the war, Spain
ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did
Macaulay write in a
fter years that Pitt "was the first Englishman of his
time; and he had made England the first country in the world."



THE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES

The various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as
they
 seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the contr
ol of popular
assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation
among them, grudging and stingy n
o doubt, but still cooperation. The
American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
trades, were s
imply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the
arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the s
cience of
statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so
tenaciously provincial in their habits, i
n the direction of nationalism.

=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with
the problems 
presented by the Indian and French menace that the
Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were man
y
common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly
fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New 
England Confederation,
composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The
colonies so united were b
ound together in "a firm and perpetual league
of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and
suc
cor, upon all just occasions." They made provision for distributing
the burdens of wars among the members and provide
d for a congress of
commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For
some twenty years the Confe
deration was active and it continued to hold
meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate

border.

Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of
intercolonial cooperation. In the midd
le of the seventeenth century, the
Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the
colonies o
f New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany
with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss
 problems of
mutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally
with the Carolinas in defending th
eir borders against Indian forays.

=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was
made in 1
754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a
conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations
, to devise
measures of defense against the French, and to enter into "articles of
union and confederation for the ge
neral defense of his Majesty's
subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of
war." New Hamps
hire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long d
iscussion, a
plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was
adopted and sent to the colonies and 
the crown for approval. The
colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the
scheme and the king d
isapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that
it had "too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution.
"
Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study
because it forecast many of the perplexing pr
oblems that were not solved
until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which
also Franklin was a 
member drafted the Constitution of the United
States.

[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]

=The Military Education of 
the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed
the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
o
f defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last
French and Indian conflict, which stretched al
l the way from Maine to
the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,
it is admitted, was 
far from satisfactory to the British government and
the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thou
sands
of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the
field. Men like George Washington and Danie
l Morgan learned lessons that
were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen
could do under fav
orable circumstances and they watched British regulars
operating on American soil. "This whole transaction," shrewdly
 remarked
Franklin of Braddock's campaign, "gave us Americans the first suspicion
that our exalted ideas of the prowe
ss of British regular troops had not
been well founded." It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel
who drew h
is sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the
army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had "spu
rned the
whistle of bullets" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.

=Financial Burdens and Commercial Diso
rder.=--While the provincials were
learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the
conflicts wer
e costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left
New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian 
struggle was
especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by
the colonies were sustained only 
by huge outlays of money. Paper
currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce
was driven from
 its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the
end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy

liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
accompanied by a commercial depression which exten
ded over a period of
ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
had to be devised to pay
 the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel
which led to American independence.

=The Expulsion of French Power f
rom North America.=--The effects of the
defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to
estimate. So
me British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
that the colonists, already restive under their administrati
on, had no
foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.
American leaders, on the other han
d, now that the soldiers of King Louis
were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country
to fear
 if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,
though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American 
influence; for,
as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by
Franklin that assured the triump
h of American arms in the War of the
Revolution.


COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT

It was neither the
 Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought
forth American nationality. That was the product of the long st
rife
with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
independence. The forces that created this nati
on did not operate in the
colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of
events in English do
mestic politics, and English measures of control
over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be

taken into account.

=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)
and the parliamentary par
ty and the turmoil of the Puritan regime
(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had
lit
tle time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660
, accompanied by
internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
House of Commons, changed a
ll that. In the reign of Charles II
(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade
by act of
 Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At
 the same
time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
the annulment of the old charter of 
Massachusetts which conferred so
much self-government on the Puritans.

Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterne
r stuff and jealous of his
authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus
inaugurated and en
larged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he
would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on i
n his
dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.
He determined to unite the Northern col
onies and introduce a more
efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He
made a martinet, 
Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New
York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in t
he last
days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of
Connecticut would have been seized if it had
 not been spirited away and
hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.

For several months, Andros gave the Nor
thern colonies a taste of
ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not
accustomed to feudal dues;
 he abrogated titles to land where, in his
opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the
Old 
South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to
a preacher who denounced taxation without repres
entation. In the middle
of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came
that King James had been
 dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people
of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside 
to
dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated
governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back 
across the sea under
guard.

The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary
and by assured par
liamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the
colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachus
etts was
given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,
restored the spirit if not the entire lette
r of self-government. In the
other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of
affairs was resumed.


=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of
Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the 
throne passed to a
Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,
was more interested in Han
over than in England. George I and George II,
whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to

speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of
taking thought about colonial affairs bored
 both of them so that the
stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no
ground to complain o
f the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.
Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of a
ffairs
was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed
his somewhat cynical view of politics b
y adopting as his motto: "Let
sleeping dogs lie." He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
by exclaiming: "I
 will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
expense of blood." Such kings and such ministers were not likely to

arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
sea.

=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=
--While no English ruler from
James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters
personally, constant
 control over the colonies was exercised by royal
officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic superv
ision
began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the
king's council to meet on Mondays and T
hursdays of each week to consider
petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696
a regular b
oard was established, known as the "Lords of Trade and
Plantations," which continued, until the American Revolution, 
to
scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were
to examine acts of colonial legislatures,
 to recommend measures to those
assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the
colonies relati
ve to their affairs.

The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by
American legislatures came b
efore it for review as a matter of routine.
If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the
exercis
e of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person
who believed his personal or property rights injured
 by a colonial law
could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it
was the practice to hear at
 the same time the agent of the colony so
involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,
therefore
, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the
suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this 
was in
addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
provinces.

=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing 
this administrative control over the
colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The
king, by v
irtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high
appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empir
e. The right
of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,
on the eve of the Revolution, ma
intained in every colony. Any subject in
England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by
any a
ct of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,
had the right, subject to certain regulations, to c
arry his case to the
king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In
the exercise of appellate
 power, the king in council acting as a court
could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
e
nacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were
contrary to English law.

=Imperial Control in Opera
tion.=--Day after day, week after week, year
after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over
coloni
al affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in
the colonies were ordered not to approve any coloni
al law imposing a
duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North
Carolina laid a tax on peddle
rs, the council objected to it as
"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures
throughout the c
ontinent." At other times, Indian trade was regulated in
the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a co
lonial
legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
North Carolina lest there should be r
etaliation.

In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
higher than that of the colony, fo
reshadowing a day when the
Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to
regulate intersta
te and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.
A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies
, as the
Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the
colonial legislatures within the metes and
 bounds of established law. In
the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the
rulings and de
cisions upon them, were written the real history of
British imperial control over the American colonies.

So great wa
s the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies
had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their inte
rests. As
common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
arose, there appeared in each colony a
 considerable body of men, with
the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
enterprise. 
Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism
. When to the
repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
Parliament applying to every col
ony, the rebound came in the Revolution.

=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament
gaine
d in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the
American colonies under its sway as well. Between 
the execution of
Charles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense
body of legislation regulati
ng the shipping, trade, and manufactures of
America. All of it, based on the "mercantile" theory then prevalent in
al
l countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas
plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and
 business
interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had
got the upper hand. According to th
is theory, the colonies of the
British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
raw materials, 
and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.

_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measure
s of
British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
the purpose of building up the British mer
chant marine and navy--arms so
essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and
French. The beginn
ing of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and
it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II

(1660-85).

The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
British ships. No trade could be
 carried on between Great Britain and
her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No
European
 goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the
country that produced them or in English ships. These law
s, which were
almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the
colonists, compelling them to pa
y higher freight rates. The adverse
effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated
shipbuilding in the
 colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave
the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mo
ther
country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
policy written into the Navigation Acts.

_
The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was
deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from 
competing too
sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may
be counted the Woolen Act of 16
99, forbidding the exportation of woolen
goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
colonies
. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New
England and New York were making thousands of hats a
 year and sending
large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,
and Portugal, it enacted in 
1732 a law declaring that "no hats or felts,
dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be "put upon any vessel
o
r laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
whatever." The effect of this measure upon the hat 
industry was almost
ruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
industry. By an act of 1750, pig 
and bar iron from the colonies were
given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw
material; but 
at the same time the law provided that "no mill or other
engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to 
work with a
tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel" should be built in the
colonies. As for those already built
, they were declared public
nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of
the colonists, t
he woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the
ban.

_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive meas
ures passed by the
British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of
1663 required the colonies t
o export certain articles to Great Britain
or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to
t
he continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom
duties and through a British merchant's hands
 paying the usual
commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the "enumerated
articles" which seriously concerne
d the American colonies, the rest
coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,
however, other c
ommodities were added to the list of enumerated
articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,

hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies
were compelled to bring their European purchase
s back through English
ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
again.

_The Molasses Act.
_--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of
English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect
 the
British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch
neighbors. New England merchants had long ca
rried on a lucrative trade
with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar
and molasses coul
d be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting
on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jama
ica,
Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on
sugar and molasses imported into the colo
nies from foreign
countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the
French and Dutch if the law
 had been enforced. The duties, however, were
not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on

merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.

=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the stric
t monopoly
of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the
policy of England was both moderate
 and liberal. Furthermore, the
restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
favorable to coloni
al prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,
redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producer
s
of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British
ports were granted to colonial producers as aga
inst foreign competitors
and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage
colonial enterprise. Taken 
all in all, there is much justification in
the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
colon
ists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial
legislation. Certainly after the establishment of ind
ependence, when
free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves
handicapped by being treated as fore
igners rather than favored traders
and the recipients of bounties in English markets.

Be that as it may, it appears 
that the colonists felt little irritation
against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
enac
ted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively
few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as
 compared with those
in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America
to agriculture did not 
conflict with the interests of the majority of
the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women

and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was
not the sole support of any considerable num
ber of people.

As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those
relating to trade, were not rig
idly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were
boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
English 
government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and
molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped
 into New
England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against
smuggling and sometimes connived at
 it; but at no time did they succeed
in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of "the galling
restrain
ts of trade" until after the French war, when the British
government suddenly entered upon a new course.


SUMMARY OF
 THE COLONIAL PERIOD

In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,
in 1607, and the close
 of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of
a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this cont
inent
to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of
migration. Western Europe contributed emigr
ants of many races and
nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical
importance were the Scotch-I
rish and the Germans. Into the melting pot
were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands
of
 negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as
domestic servants in the North.

Why did they c
ome? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims
and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Ir
ish and
Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments
that denied them the right to worship 
God according to the dictates of
their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
the Old World 
and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the
negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The
 lure of
adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
enterprising merchants.

How did they come
? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. 
In other
cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it
was the wealthy proprietor, like Lo
rd Baltimore or William Penn, who
undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their
own way acro
ss the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years
in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were bro
ught on account
of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.

Whatever the motive for their coming, however, the
y managed to get
across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down
forests, built houses, and lai
d out fields. They founded churches,
schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and
wove. The
y fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and
traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established
 centers of
commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
Charleston. As soon as a firm footho
ld was secured on the shore line
they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they
were already 
on the crest of the Alleghanies.

Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,
the colonists
 were united in spirit by many common ties. The major
portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and th
e
literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the
colonists were engaged in the same hard ta
sk; that of conquering a
wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
necessity. They had t
o unite in defense; first, against the Indians and
later against the French. They were all subjects of the same
sover
eign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for
them and the English government supervised their loca
l affairs, their
trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common
grievances vexed them. Common hop
es inspired them.

Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
them into opposition to the
 British Crown and Parliament. Most of them
were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled
it
 with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.
The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, no
t friends, of the
Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each
colony in time developed its 
own legislature elected by the voters; it
grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a
peop
le learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to
strengthen the Church of England in America and the tr
ansformation of
colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
which they were designed to quen
ch.

Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the
assistance of the government that irritated the
m. It was the protection
of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from
wiping out their settleme
nts. Though their manufacture and trade were
controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed
gre
at advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the
earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to 
American ships and
merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
which the colonists suffer
ed through British regulation of their
industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.
Still
 that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is
not necessarily the determining factor in the fate
 of peoples. A
thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,
to inspire it with a passion 
for independence, and to prepare it for a
destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British
empire. T
he economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
America would be richer under the British flag, could no
t change the
spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George
Washington.

PART I
I. CONFLICT AND INDEPENDENCE




CHAPTER V

THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY


On October 25, 1760, King Geo
rge II died and the British crown passed to
his young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover
a
nd Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never
even learned to speak the language of the lan
d over which he reigned.
The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English
with an accent and 
until his death preferred his German home. During
their reign, the principle had become well established that the kin
g did
not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
Parliament.


GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTE
M

=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the
German tradition of his family. He resented th
e imputation that he was a
foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.
To the draft of h
is first speech to Parliament, he added the popular
phrase: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name o
f
Briton." Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for
high royal prerogative, said of George: "The y
oung king was a born
Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No
portion of his subjects ha
d anything to reproach him with.... His age,
his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated
publ
ic favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were
pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and fla
ttery might without
glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues."

Nevertheless George III had been spoile
d by his mother, his tutors, and
his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty
notions about the 
sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it
. His
mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: "George, be king!" Lord
Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him
 that his honor required him
to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
laws. Thus educ
ated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdu
e all
parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.

GEORG
E III]

=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties
favored the plans of the king to rest
ore some of the ancient luster of
the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller
freeholders, merchant
s, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant
non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long
continuance i
n power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this 
time given up
all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they
still cherished their old notions 
about divine right. With the
accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
around the throne 
again. George received his Tory friends with open
arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Comm
ons.

=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British
Parliament at the time made smooth the wa
y for the king and his allies
with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first
place, the House
 of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
number the king could increase by the appointment of his fav
orites, as
of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by
popular vote, they did not speak for th
e mass of English people. Great
towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no
representatives at 
all. While there were about eight million inhabitants
in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters;
 that is
to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
government. Many boroughs returned one or
 more members to the Commons
although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
voters at all. Furt
hermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highes
t bidder.
The "rotten-boroughs," as they were called by reformers, were a public
scandal, but George III readily made
 use of them to get his friends into
the House of Commons.


GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES

=Gre
nville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of
George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, th
e king treating him
with "gross incivility" and the crowds shouting "Pitt forever!" The
direction of affairs was entr
usted to men enjoying the king's
confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,
a grave and
 laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
cost of government.

The first task after the conclusion
 of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest
point i
n the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely
necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his
 attention
finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a
zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, 
who had long been in public
service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
governors in America.
 These two men, with the support of the entire
ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, "a new system of colonial
gov
ernment. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more
requisitions from the king to the colonial assem
blies for supplies, but
that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.
Colonial governors and judge
s were to be paid by the Crown; they were to
be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the
expense
s of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation."

=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many comp
laints filed
before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
paper money by the colonial leg
islatures. The new ministry provided a
remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws
authorizing p
aper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This
law was aimed at the "cheap money" which the Americans we
re fond of
making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their
English creditors in return for go
ods and in payment of the interest and
principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long
battle over
 sound money on this continent.

=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)
George III issued
 a royal proclamation providing, among other things,
for the government of the territory recently acquired by the tre
aty of
Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree
touched frontiersmen to the quick. The conte
sts between the king's
officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
been long and sharp. The 
Americans chafed at restrictions on
settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and
"squatting" on 
land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without
authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all furth
er purchases
from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
and dispose of them for settlem
ent. A second provision in the same
proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,
including the 
lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in
the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and
 enterprise
were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
preservation of the rights of the Indians ag
ainst fraud and abuses.

=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their
attention to measures of
 taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under
which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense o
f
America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
that the colonies should help to bear the burd
en which fell so heavily
upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this
reasoning. There was
 no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was
set forth clearly in the title: "An act for granting certain duti
es in
the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the
produce of such duties ... towards defrayi
ng the expenses of defending,
protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for
more effectually 
preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securi
ng the
trade between the same and Great Britain." The old Molasses Act had been
prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 wa
s clearly intended as a revenue
measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,
and many other
 commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement
of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sug
ar Act had
"teeth in it." Special precautions as to bonds, security, and
registration of ship masters, accompanied by
 heavy penalties, promised
a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.

The strict terms of the Sugar Act were stren
gthened by administrative
measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
vessels stationed along 
the American coast were authorized to stop,
search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial
port
s. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in
America was instructed to be diligent in the executi
on of all trade and
navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
royal governors were curt
ly ordered to the front to do their full duty
in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharg
e
of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for
naval officers who seized offenders against the
 law were rewarded by
large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.

=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Town
shend combination moved
steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration
in Parliament, Grenvil
le announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next
year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded

its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;
while in the Lords it was not even necessary 
to go through the formality
of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received
royal assent by a 
commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of
colonial agents in London were futile. "We might as well have hi
ndered
the sun's progress!" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in
the Commons were equally vain. The min
istry was firm in its course and
from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid
interest in th
e city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful
measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a 
commission to
act for the king when he was incapacitated.

The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of
 the British
government to raise revenue in America "towards defraying the expenses
of defending, protecting, and sec
uring the British colonies and
plantations in America." It was a long measure of more than fifty
sections, carefully 
planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions
duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
transacti
ons,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on
licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college dipl
omas, playing
cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and
advertisements. The drag net was closely k
nit, for scarcely anything
escaped.

=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp
Act would 
rouse opposition in America--how great they could not
conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of Ge
neral
Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous
warning in the Commons. "Believe me--remember
 I this day told you so--"
he exclaimed, "the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
first will accompa
ny them still ... a people jealous of their liberties
and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated." 
The
answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.
Preparations were accordingly made to dispat
ch a larger number of
soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
Stamp Act when Parliamen
t passed the Quartering Act ordering the
colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
the
 new laws. "We have the power to tax them," said one of the ministry,
"and we will tax them."


COLONIAL RESISTANCE F
ORCES REPEAL

=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an
outburst of denunciation. The merchan
ts of the seaboard cities took the
lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to
import Britis
h goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,
some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operatio
ns and others
intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
papers, joined with the merchants. Ar
istocratic colonial Whigs, who had
long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested
against taxation
 without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old
England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in Engla
nd--many
of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
Whig aristocrats as "seditious, fac
tious and republican." Yet the
opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering
Act, grew ste
adily all through the summer of 1765.

In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
countryside. Al
l through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,
there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies p
ledged to
resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were
known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters
 of Liberty: the former including
artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both
groups wer
e alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were ex
cluded from the
right to vote for colonial assemblymen.

While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their effort
s chiefly to
drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of
Liberty operated in the streets and
 chose rougher measures. They stirred
up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts
were m
ade to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of
high royal officers. They organized committees of in
quisition who by
threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use
of stamped papers. In fact,
 the Sons of Liberty carried their operations
to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
frighte
ned and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were mak
ing a very
effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
domestic industries, their own particul
ar province being the manufacture
of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to
feed and clot
he their families without buying British goods.

=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial

assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the
popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed o
n March 22, 1765. On May 30,
the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
that the General A
ssembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwis
e were
"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust." It was in support of these
resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the
 immortal challenge: "Caesar
had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III...." Cries of
"Treason" were calm
ly met by the orator who finished: "George III may
profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it."


[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]

=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call
of Virginia 
by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to
be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colon
ies responded
and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest
affection for the king's person a
nd government, firmly spread on record
a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They
declared that
 taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given
through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp
 Act showed
a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade
acts were burdensome and grievous
; and that the right to petition the
king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made "humble
supplication
" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.

The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked
the rise o
f a new agency of government to express the will of America.
It was the germ of a government which in time was to sup
ersede the
government of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress
of the United States under the Cons
titution. It was a successful attempt
at union. "There ought to be no New England men," declared Christopher
Gadsden,
 in the Stamp Act Congress, "no New Yorkers known on the
Continent, but all of us Americans."

=The Repeal of the Sta
mp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American
resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the co
lonies
had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging
at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened
 hundreds of merchants in London,
Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England
were throw
n out of employment. The government had sown folly and was
reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.

Perp
lexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the
bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the
 agent for
Pennsylvania, who was in London. "Do you think it right," asked
Grenville, "that America should be protect
ed by this country and pay no
part of the expenses?" The answer was brief: "That is not the case; the
colonies raised
, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five
thousand men and spent many millions." Then came an inquiry wheth
er the
colonists would accept a modified stamp act. "No, never," replied
Franklin, "never! They will never submit to 
it!" It was next suggested
that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready
answer. "They cann
ot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a
rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."

The repeal of the Stam
p Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days
later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, d
ebts
due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,
workingmen unemployed, oppression instit
uted, and the loss of the
colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close
of his career, the la
tter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor
of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.
"A
merica must learn," he wailed, "that prayers are not to be brought to
Caesar through riot and sedition." His protests
 were idle. The Commons
agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
victorious majority. It was
 carried through the Lords in the face of
strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now
res
tored to his right mind.

In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of
the Americans that 
it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it
accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced tha
t the
colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;
that the king and Parliament therefore 
had undoubted authority to make
laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the
resolutions and proce
edings of the colonists denying such authority were
null and void.

The repeal was greeted by the colonists with grea
t popular
demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and
trade resumed its normal course. The De
claratory Act, as a mere paper
resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
the name of King
 George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the
news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practical
ly
restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend
inaugurated their policy of "thoroughness."


RE
SUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES

=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was b
rief.
Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and
seated in the House of Lords as the Earl 
of Chatham, his severe illness
gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.
Unconvinced by
 the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought
forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three meas
ures,
which to this day are associated with his name. First among his
restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, whi
ch placed the enforcement
of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
in the hands of Bri
tish commissioners appointed by the king, resident in
the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent o
f all
control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a
tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a f
ew other articles imported into
the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
the payment of
 the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed 
at the
tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This
law abolished the duty which the East
 India Company had to pay in
England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea
merchants might 
thus find it possible to undersell American tea
smugglers.

=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parli
ament been
content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,
and neglected their collection, pe
rhaps little would have been heard of
the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the
harsh, enfor
cement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at
their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue a
ct of June 29,
1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
issue "writs of assistance," empo
wering customs officers to enter "any
house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies
or plant
ations in America to search for and seize" prohibited or
smuggled goods.

The writ of assistance, which was a general
 search warrant issued to
revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who
cherished the spirit of per
sonal independence and who had made actual
gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a "minion of the law"
to 
enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much
for the emotions of people who had fled to Ameri
ca in a quest for
self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to
establish them, and who wanted to 
trade without official interference.

The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
illici
t trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter co
ntroversy which
arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
Massachusetts court for writs of a
ssistance "as usual." This application
was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a
speech
 of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
away "ready to take up arms against writs of assistan
ce." Otis denounced
the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
his head and another his t
hrone, a tyrant's device which placed the
liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work
possib
le malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to
spread terror and desolation through the land. "Wha
t a scene," he
exclaimed, "does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
or wantonness to inspect the in
side of his neighbor's house, may get a
writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary
exert
ion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
blood." He did more than attack the writ itself. He 
said that Parliament
could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.
This was an assertion re
sting on slender foundation, but it was quickly
echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to
A
merica to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.
"Then and there," wrote John Adams, "the child In
dependence was born."
Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of
customs officers in hi
s grim determination to enforce the law.

=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's
Acts
 were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.
The assembly of New York, protesting against the
 "ruinous and
insupportable" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the
care of British troops in accorda
nce with the terms of the Quartering
Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
obey the l
aw. It was not until a third election was held that compliance
with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant p
rovince. In the
meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
representative bodies rested.



RENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA

=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the
leadership of Samuel 
Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed
intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a
Cir
cular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusett
s and roundly
condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that
Parliament had no right to lay 
taxes on Americans without their consent
and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be
represente
d in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to
consideration the question as to whether any people could be called
 free
who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
paid out of funds raised independently. I
t invited the other colonies,
in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common
predicament in which they
 were all placed.

[Illustration: _From an old print._

SAMUEL ADAMS]

=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor
 of Massachusetts, hearing
of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On
meeting refusal, he
 promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and
South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were al
so
dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declar
ing that the sole right of
imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew
the right of peti
tion to the crown, condemning the transportation of
persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseechin
g the
king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution
of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, 
was the answer of the royal
governor.

=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities
kept st
eadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of
citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing num
bers among
the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British
goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed
 their agitation, and women set about
the patronage of home products still more loyally.

On the night of March 5, 17
70, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to
jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things
we
nt from bad to worse until some "boys and young fellows" began to
throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated so
ldiers fired into the
crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the
"massacre," a mass meetin
g was held in the town and Samuel Adams was
sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated
and
 tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded
and ordered the regulars away.

The Boston Massa
cre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.
Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged wi
th murder.
Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by
John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who 
as lawyers thought even the worst

offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the
jury, however
, Adams warned the British government against its course,
saying, that "from the nature of things soldiers quartered 
in a populous
town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one." Two of
the soldiers were convicted and
 lightly punished.

=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some
citizens of North Carolin
a, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,
openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven

who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal
troops and local militia met in a pitched bat
tle near Alamance River,
called the "Lexington of the South."

=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1
773.=--On sea as
well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists
broke out into overt acts. Wh
ile patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for
smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was
c
aught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the
vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fi
re. A royal commission,
sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to
account, failed because it c
ould not find a single informer. The very
appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to
action
; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution
creating a standing committee of correspondence to d
evelop cooperation
among the colonies in resistance to British measures.

=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the Briti
sh government, finding the
Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except
that on tea, it in
 no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,
Par
liament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the
financial difficulties into which it had fallen part
ly by reason of the
Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to
return to the Company the re
gular import duties, levied in England, on
all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be
coll
ected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the ri
ght to tax the
colonists.

This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the
colonists for several re
asons. It was an act of favoritism for one
thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it
promised
 to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of
cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merch
ants who had large
stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who
were engaged in clandestine 
trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an
irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New
Y
ork, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, 
a band of Boston citizens,
disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
into the harbor. Th
is was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,
determined violation of the law. As such the British government v
iewed
it.


RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT

=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot
 in
Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no
soft policy in dealing with his American s
ubjects. "The die is cast," he
stated with evident satisfaction. "The colonies must either triumph or
submit.... If w
e take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very
meek." Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as "th
e
proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had
the least prudence, to follow their mercantil
e employments and not
trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not
understand." This expressed,
 in concise form, exactly the sentiments of
Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.

Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in
upholding its authority.

=The Five Intolerable Ac
ts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,
passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five

"intolerable acts." They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The
_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutti
ng the port of Boston to
commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,
revoked the Massachusetts 
charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that
the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should

be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect
certain officers) could not be held without t
he governor's consent. A
_third_ measure, after denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful
government" in the pro
vinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to
Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
per
sons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.
The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of tr
oops in Massachusetts
towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted
religious toleration to th
e Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries
of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this wester
n
region, government by a viceroy.

The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary
celerity. There w
as an opposition, alert and informed; but it was
ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,
co
ndemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and
showing how likely it was to bring grave conseque
nces in its train. He
was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both
houses without a divis
ion, the entry "unanimous" being made upon their
journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opini
on.
The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a
vote of three to one; and the third intol
erable act by a vote of four to
one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. "What passed in Boston,"
exclaimed the
 great jurist, Lord Mansfield, "is the overt act of High
Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresigh
t." The
crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.

In the colonies the laws were received w
ith consternation. To the
American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That
project they viewed not a
s an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The
Br
itish government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics
either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could
 see no good motive
in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because
Massachusetts, Connecticut, a
nd Virginia had, under their charters,
large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.

To enforce these intole
rable acts the military arm of the British
government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed
forc
es in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of
Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, fo
r now King
George was to give "the rebels," as he called them, a taste of strong
medicine. The majesty of his law was
 to be vindicated by force.


FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA

=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolutio
n of assemblies, the
destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
a new phase in the strug
gle. In the early days of the contest with the
British ministry, the Americans spoke of their "rights as Englishmen"

and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the
principles of the English constitution under which
 they all lived. When
they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned
for support to their "nat
ural rights." The latter doctrine, in the form
in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the
const
itutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in
defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth c
entury. American
leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in
the hour of their distress.
 They openly declared that their rights did
not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the
cr
own. "Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things," retorted
Otis when the constitutional argument failed. "A
 time may come when
Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,
inherent, and inseparable 
rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
un
til the general conflagration." Of the same opinion was the young and
impetuous Alexander Hamilton. "The sacred right
s of mankind," he
exclaimed, "are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records. They are written as w
ith a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or
obscure
d by mortal power."

Firm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their
rights, there is every r
eason for believing that in the beginning they
hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly

avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
language against his policies. Even Otis, r
egarded by the loyalists as a
firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
concessions from Engla
nd. "I argue this cause with the greater
pleasure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
assistance, 
"as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in
opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in for
mer periods
cost one king of England his head and another his throne."

=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=-
-The flooding tide of
American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,
Edmund Burke, who quickly
 saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
American democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He
saw
 how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American
spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned hi
s countrymen that
there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only
three. One was to remove the cau
se of friction by changing the spirit of
the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
in th
e essential circumstances of American life. The second was to
prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he beg
ged his
countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that "a government
against which a claim of liberty is tantam
ount to high treason is a
government to which submission is equivalent to slavery." The third and
right way to meet t
he problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the
American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the coloni
es
into equal partnership.

=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,
was equally impo
ssible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To
their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and Ame
rican
resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their
view, was to dispatch more troops to c
rush the "rebels"; and that very
act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:
"Facts are stubb
orn things." Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers
were visible to the veriest street urchin. "Now," said Gouve
rneur
Morris, "the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
It was too late to talk about the exce
llence of the British
constitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
historians as to why the 
crisis came at last, he can clarify his
understanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately oration, _On
Conciliati
on with America_.

CHAPTER VI

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION


RESISTANCE AND RETALIATION

=The Conti
nental Congress.=--When the news of the "intolerable acts"
reached America, every one knew what strong medicine Parli
ament was
prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority. The
cause of Massachusetts became the cause
 of all the colonies. Opposition
to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national
character. T
o local committees and provincial conventions was added a
Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts
 on June 17,
1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons
was electric. By hurried and irreg
ular methods delegates were elected
during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in
Carpenter's 
Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America
were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virgin
ia and John
and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was
represented. Some were impatient with mil
d devices; the majority favored
moderation.

The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in
clea
r and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It
approved the resistance to British measures offered by M
assachusetts and
promised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to
King George and another to th
e people of England, disavowing the idea of
independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British
gov
ernment.

=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,
with professions of faith and with
 petitions. It took one revolutionary
step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,
and the 
enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
"committees of safety and inspection," to be elected by
 the qualified
voters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw
itself athwart British law. It made
 a rule to bind American citizens and
to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within
the Br
itish state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.
The colonists, who up to this moment had been waveri
ng, had to choose
one authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the
non-importation agreement or they 
were against it. They either bought
English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--"May Britain
be wise a
nd America be free"--the first Continental Congress adjourned
in October, having appointed the tenth of May following
 for the meeting
of a second Congress, should necessity require.

=Lord North's "Olive Branch."=--When the news of th
e action of the
American Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal
of the obnoxious laws, but in
 vain. All they could wring from the prime
minister, Lord North, was a set of "conciliatory resolutions" proposing
to
 relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
imperial defense and make provision for supporting t
he local officers of
the crown. This "olive branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
the king of support at a
ll hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the
c
ommerce of New England.

=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the
British authorities in
 Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military
st
ores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize
them. By this act he precipitated the conflict 
he had sought to avoid.
At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred "the little thing" that
produced "the great ev
ent." An unexpected collision beyond the thought
or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to 
the
battle field.

=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war
was actually at hand, the s
econd Continental Congress, which met at
Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was
beyon
d human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
colonists in order that the empire might avoid th
e calamities of civil
war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to
Lord North's offer of conc
iliation, stating that the proposal was
unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
the off
ensive acts of Parliament.

=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America
were about to presen
t the last petition of Congress to the king on
August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This
a
nnouncement declared that the colonists, "misled by dangerous and
ill-designing men," were in a state of insurrection
; it called on the
civil and military powers to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
threatened with "condign puni
shment the authors, perpetrators, and
abettors of such traitorous designs." It closed with the usual prayer:
"God, sa
ve the king." Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping
act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. 
Congress was
silent at last. Force was also America's answer.


AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE

=Drifting into War.=--Although
 the Congress had not given up all hope of
reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved
to
 defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the
militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the 
battle of Lexington,
into a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.
It assumed the powers of 
a government and prepared to raise money, wage
war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.

[Illus
tration: _From an old print_

SPIRIT OF 1776]

Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by
t
he stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British
regulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3
, Washington took command
of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments
in drumming up rec
ruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,
the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of

Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands
of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This
 was the crowning insult to
America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
of the water. Suc
h was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative
historian Lecky: "The conduct of England in hiring German mer
cenaries to
subdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made
reconciliation hopeless and independen
ce inevitable." The news of this
wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America
before there ran 
all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington
had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to s
ail with
his entire army for Halifax.

=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were
bearin
g the Americans away from their old position under the British
constitution toward a final separation. Slowly and aga
inst their
desires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united
them to the old order and dreaded w
ith genuine horror all thought of
revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In
all parts o
f the country and among all classes, the question of the hour
was being debated. "American independence," as the hist
orian Bancroft
says, "was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
assembly. It had been discussed
 in every part of the country by farmers
and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the
coast a
nd the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the
pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires
; in county
conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and
assemblies."

[Illustration: _From 
an old print_

THOMAS PAINE]

=Paine's "Commonsense."=--In the midst of this ferment of American
opinion, a bold and 
eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and

without apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the
first of his famous tracts, "Commonsense," a pa
ssionate attack upon the
British monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.
Casting aside the lang
uage of petition with which Americans had hitherto
addressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed
 him
with many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system
which had laid the world "in blood and ash
es." Instead of praising the
British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
rights, he brushed it
 aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was "owing
to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the

government, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in
Turkey."

Having thus summarily swept away the grou
nds of allegiance to the old
order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
separation from Great B
ritain. There was nothing in the sphere of
practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the
mot
her country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
in which they had been involved. Reasons of tra
de were not less weighty
in behalf of independence. "Our corn will fetch its price in any market
in Europe and our im
ported goods must be paid for, buy them where we
will." As to matters of government, "it is not in the power of Brita
in
to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too
weighty and intricate to be managed with any tol
erable degree of
convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us."

There is accordingly no alte
rnative to independence for America.
"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of
the sla
in, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...
Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the ap
peal was the
choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The
sun never shone on a cause of g
reater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a
city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not
the c
oncern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the
contest and will be more or less affected to the end 
of time by the
proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and
honor.... O! ye that love manki
nd! Ye that dare oppose not only the
tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be
extinct. 
Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,
an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter 
of the rights of
mankind and of the free and independent states of America." As more than
100,000 copies were scatter
ed broadcast over the country, patriots
exclaimed with Washington: "Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!"

=The Dr
ift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the
idea of independence began to come from many quarters. 
On the tenth of
February, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,
advocated a new constitution
 for the colony and absolute independence
for all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way
by a
bolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
complete plan of self-government. A month later, on A
pril 12, the
neighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
others shrank. It empowered its
 representatives in the Congress to
concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
independence. Rhode 
Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly
responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May
15
, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence
of the United Colonies and to give the assent 
of Virginia to the act of
separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the
state house was lowered
 for all time.

Meanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events
outside. The subject of independ
ence was constantly being raised. "Are
we rebels?" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.
"No: we m
ust declare ourselves a free people." Others hesitated and
spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conci
liation. "Is
not America already independent?" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.
"Why not then declare it?" Still
 there was uncertainty and delegates
avoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,
Congress 
declared that the authority of the British crown in America
must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up gov
ernments of
their own.

[Illustration: _From an old print_

THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF

INDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]

=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,
on
 June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that "these
united colonies are and of right ought to be free 
and independent
states." A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
document setting forth the reasons f
or the act, and on July 2 all the
states save New York went on record in favor of severing their political
connection
 with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft
of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some sl
ight particulars,
was adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang
out the glad tidings; cour
iers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among

the powers of the world.

To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence
is one of them. Am
erican patriotism is forever associated with it; but
patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vig
or of
its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
the records of time. The secret of its
 greatness lies in the simple fact
that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
ideal whic
h for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shak
ing down
thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
battle fields as far apart as Marst
on Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That
ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple
sentence: "Govern
ments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed."

Written in a "decent respect for the opinions of m
ankind," to set forth
the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from
Britain, the Declaration cont
ained a long list of "abuses and
usurpations" which had induced them to throw off the government of King
George. That
 section of the Declaration has passed into "ancient"
history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new ba
sis for
government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
household phrase in the Old World as 
in the New.

In the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,
from the standpoint of the old sys
tem of government, were the essence of
revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their
Creator wit
h certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is 
to secure these
rights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed; (4) whenever any f
orm of government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
institut
e new government, laying its foundations on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form as to them shall s
eem most likely to
effect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic
drama of democracy--a chal
lenge to every form of government and every
privilege not founded on popular assent.


THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMEN
T AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE

=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into
armed resistance, th
e patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, 
for
the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and
committees of correspondence. The working t
ools of the Revolution were
in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial
groups of patriots for
med to exchange views and create public sentiment.
As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in B
oston
under the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent
emissaries to neighboring towns, and carri
ed on a campaign of education
in the doctrines of liberty.

[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME 
OF THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]

Upon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee
were built
 county committees and then the larger colonial committees,
congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and represent
ing the
revolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
the old legislative assembly freed fr
om all royalist sympathizers and
controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was
built the Contin
ental Congress, the precursor of union under the
Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of t
he
United States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the
British empire in America.

=State Constitu
tions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of
the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From th
e royal
provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,
and it became necessary to substitut
e patriot authorities. The appeal to
the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
themselves, iss
ued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.
Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Penn
sylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions
as states, not as colonies uncertai
n of their destinies. Connecticut and
Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
needs, me
rely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
before so far as the form of government was concerned. Sou
th Carolina,
which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
complete constitution in 1778. 
Two years later Massachusetts with much
deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its
essenti
al features remains unchanged to-day.

The new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
models. 
For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instance
s, New York and
Massachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was
substituted, except in Georgia, 
a senate; while the lower house, or
assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property
restriction on
 the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was
continued in full force to the great discontent of the mec
hanics thus
deprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several
constitutions, for governors, se
nators, and representatives, indicated
that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
experiments i
n democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John
Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, ag
ainst a
government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
mild curiosities of no significance, alt
hough in New Jersey women were
allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.

By the new state constitutio
ns the signs and symbols of royal power, of
authority derived from any source save "the people," were swept aside
and
 republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
time to the modern world. Copies of these remark
able documents prepared
by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in
Europe. There they wer
e destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin t
he
democratic revolution in the Old World.

=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions
wa
s an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build
on foundations already laid. The establishment o
f a national system of
government was another matter. There had always been, it must be
remembered, a system of centr
al control over the colonies, but Americans
had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the
c
rown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,
accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were p
oorly trained for
action on a national stage.

Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of
n
ational destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce
and industry in the North and the planting sys
tem of the South. There
were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
for common defense. To
 these practical difficulties were added local
pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
pro
vincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
the common enterprise.

Nevertheless, necessity co
mpelled them to consider some sort of
federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work
before t
he most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress 
resolved to go
into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,
undaunted by the fate of his Al
bany plan of twenty years before, again
presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed
and 
it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states
the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealous
ies delayed
ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the
surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown,
 when Maryland, the last of the
states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all
that could be wr
ung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a
chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simp
ly a
Congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
the right to call upon the state legisl
atures for the sinews of
government--money and soldiers.

=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successiv
e steps were
taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised
and applied tests designed to dis
cover who were for and who were against
the new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental
Congress 
agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it
provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the
 rules. Such
agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all
opponents being excluded from th
e elections. Before these bodies those
who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or
punished acc
ording to circumstances. As soon as the new state
constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in
 the
same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
the new order of things.

[Illustration: M
OBBING THE TORIES]

These patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,
were sometimes ruthless in
 their methods. They called upon all men to
sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "association test."
Tho
se who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the
more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison c
amp in Connecticut at
one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New
York. Thousands were black
-listed and subjected to espionage. The
black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
persons
 of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who
were bold enough to speak and write against the Revo
lution were
suppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in
the North, the property of the loy
alists was confiscated and the
proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.

The work of the official agencies fo
r suppression of opposition was
sometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without
trial, and o
thers were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake
of ice and held there "until his loyalty to King George m
ight cool."
Whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
they could within the British lin
es or into Canada, where the British
government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,
but they 
were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well
as a war for independence, was being waged.

=The Pat
riots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who
were to be citizens of the new republic were separated
 from those who
preferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the
Americans favored independence a
nd what share remained loyal to the
British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution
was not s
ubmitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have
conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the
 testimony of a
careful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds
of the people were for the Am
erican cause and not more than one-third
opposed the Revolution at all stages.

On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories
 as they were popularly known,
extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of
the first Cont
inental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its
temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 t
hat not
one-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that
"many more than four-fifths of the peopl
e prefer a union with Great
Britain upon constitutional principles to independence." At the same
time General Roberts
on, who had lived in America twenty-four years,
declared that "more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the
ki
ng's government to the Congress' tyranny." In an address to the king
in that year a committee of American loyalists a
sserted that "the number
of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
enlisted by Congress to opp
ose them."

=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,
more than a thousand people fled w
ith him. This great company, according
to a careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the province by
virtue of t
heir official rank; of their dignified callings and
professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture." Th
e act
of banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,
"reads like the social register of the 
oldest and noblest families of
New England," more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard
College. The same w
as true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that
the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,
c
lergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought
against the inevitable or with anguish of heart the
y left as refugees
for a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.

=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tor
ies who remained in America joined
the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
cause. Those wh
o were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They dec
lared
that the members of Congress were "obscure, pettifogging attorneys,
bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, e
tc." The people and their
leaders they characterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
dregs of mankind." The 
generals in the army they sneered at as "men of
rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress."

=Patriot
 Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,
patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and susta
ining a public
opinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat
the depression that grew out of 
the misfortunes in the early days of the
war. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the
winter
 of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a
disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities ha
rassed Washington in
1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and
beaten at Harlem Height
s and White Plains. These reverses were almost
too great for the stoutest patriots.

Pamphleteers, preachers, and pub
licists rose, however, to meet the needs
of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,
forsook
 the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,
Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tor
ies and celebrated
the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,
and satires flowed from the 
press in an unending stream. Fast days,
battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress
affor
ded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.
"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?" anxiously
 inquired John
Adams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. "The clergy of
every denomination, not excepti
ng the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten
every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God
most e
xplicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray
for the American army."

Thomas Paine never let his p
en rest. He had been with the forces of
Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New
Jersey
 into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the
army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he m
ade a second great
appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, "The Crisis," the first part
of which he had written whi
le defeat and gloom were all about him. This
tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. "These are the

times that try men's souls," he opened. "The summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink fro
m the service of his
country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
and women." Paine laid hi
s lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every
one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, self-interested fear." H
e
deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He
refuted the charge that the retreat through N
ew Jersey was a disaster
and he promised victory soon. "By perseverance and fortitude," he
concluded, "we have the pr
ospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and
submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a
de
populated city, habitations without safety and slavery without
hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it." His r
inging call to
arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
over.


MILITARY AFFAIRS

=The Two
 Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of
Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surre
nder of
Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct
phases--the first lasting until the t
reaty of alliance with France, in
1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first
phase, the war
 was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding
features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the Briti
sh,
the expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through
New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the s
eizure of Philadelphia by the
British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his
capture at Sara
toga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American
forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.

The
 final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with
France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to 
the Middle states,
the West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events
were the withdrawal of the
 British from Philadelphia, the battle of
Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying
America
n forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the
West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into th
e Illinois
country, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
country between the Ohio and the Grea
t Lakes. In the South, the second
period opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,
conquered Geo
rgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized
Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American
 forces under
Gates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at
Cowpens and King's Mountain. Th
en came the closing scenes. Cornwallis
began the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into
North Car
olina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the
coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plund
ering Virginia, and
fortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the
sea and the combined Fren
ch and American forces on land.

=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of
the war offer
ed many problems. From first to last it extended from
Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles
. It was
nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though
the British navy kept the channel ope
n, transports were constantly
falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The
sea, on the other
 hand, offered an easy means of transportation between
points along the coast and gave ready access to the American c
enters of
wealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early
forced to give up Boston, they seize
d New York and kept it until the end
of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
the appro
ach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both
Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by th
e conquest
of cities.

Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small
portion of the American
 people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the
coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They live
d on
the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact
gave strength to them in the contest. Whe
never the British ventured far
from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced
to surrender a
t Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Char
leston, they
were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,
and Pickens. Cornwallis could tec
hnically defeat Greene at Guilford far
in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.
Susta
ined by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their
armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from na
tive resources, the
Americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
blow.

=The Sea Power.=--T
he British made good use of their fleet in cutting
off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affec
t the
United States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was
not such a vital matter. All the materi
als for a comfortable though
somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a
nation fighting fo
r existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were
cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.


Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry
materially change the situation. They demons
trated the skill of American
seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of
British marine insura
nce, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of th
e
hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply
ships and kept British merchantmen in const
ant anxiety. Not until the
French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to
reckon seriously wit
h the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
possibilities of a maritime disaster.

=Commanding Officers.=--O
n the score of military leadership it is
difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.
The
re is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience
in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had ser
ved in America during the
French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict
disciplinarian, and a gallant g
entleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,
society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to
overwhe
lm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York
and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his milita
ry reputation. John
Burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from
Canada, had likewise seen servi
ce in the French War both in America and
Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
after t
he collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,
he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir H
enry Clinton, who
directed the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,
had "learned his trade on t
he continent," and was regarded as a man of
discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose

achievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Year
s' War and had undoubted
talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
India. Though none of t
hem, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,
they all had training and experience to guide them.

[Illustration: GEO
RGE WASHINGTON]

The Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been
interested in military strategy and
 had tested his coolness under fire
during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He
had no do
ubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of
the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disc
iplinarian. He
was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or
depression at reverses. In the dark
 hour of the Revolution, "what held
the patriot forces together?" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John
Marshall_. Then
 he answers: "George Washington and he alone. Had he
died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended
....
Washington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the
government. Washington was the Revolution." Th
e weakness of Congress in
furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at
ease while the army s
tarved, the intrigues of army officers against him
such as the "Conway cabal," the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even
 the
treason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his
breast and aroused him to make passionate pl
eas to his countrymen, did
not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
to the bitter end
. The weight of Washington's moral force was
immeasurable.

Of the generals who served under him, none can really be 
said to have
been experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the
unhappy traitor but brave and da
ring soldier, was a druggist, book
seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called
him to battl
e. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a "seasoned soldier"
because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been
 wounded at
Braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven
Years' War; but he was the most 
conspicuous failure of the Revolution.
The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing
defeat a
t Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael
Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without militar
y experience
who, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and
took up the sword. Francis Mar
ion was a shy and modest planter of South
Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
wi
th the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the
heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Bra
ddock's army and had seen
some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military
knowledge, from the point 
of view of a trained British officer, was
negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New
Hampshire,
 and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne 
was a
Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,
read a few books on war, raised a regi
ment, and offered himself for
service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and
it is typical of
 them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and
Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale wit
h regular
troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European
experience. Courage, native ability, quickne
ss of mind, and knowledge of
the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought
during the Revolut
ion all those qualities counted heavily in the
balance.

=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius wa
s added
military talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in
the iron regime of Frederick the Great,
 came over from Prussia, joined
Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
men, laughi
ng and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De K
alb, from
Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war
as waged in Europe and fitted for l
eadership as well as teaching.
Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by
several officers o
f wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the
war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell 
at the
siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American
war to defend in vain the independenc
e of his native land. To these
distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American
revolutionary fo
rtunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which
fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope wit
h a military
power of the first rank.

=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their
annals ar
e short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who
were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruit
s drummed up
by special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought
outright by King George presented few p
roblems of management to the
British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and
enlisted for the war
. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King Georg
e
fought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth
demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate off
icer and, for that matter,
some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
their own kin; but th
ey obeyed orders.

The Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim
determination, as men fighting for t
heir homes, were lacking in
discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke
in upon them, ther
e were no common preparations for it. There was no
continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many 
of
them experienced in fighting but few of them "regulars" in the military
sense. Moreover they were volunteers servi
ng for a short time,
unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints
imposed on them by long and a
rduous campaigns. They were continually
leaving the service just at the most critical moments. "The militia,"
lamente
d Washington, "come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell
where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores;
 and leave you at
last at a critical moment."

Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of
r
egulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to
some definite plan. At last he was able to ove
rcome, in part at least,
the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that
reluctant body an agreement
 to grant half pay to all officers and a
bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this
scheme,
 which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the
soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the cl
ose of the
conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of
meeting British regulars on equal t
erms.

Though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
effective work, it is due to historic
al accuracy to deny the
time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
forces of regulars in a
 seven years' war for independence. They did
nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,

and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White
Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did 
an army of militiamen
overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.
"To bring men to be we
ll acquainted with the duties of a soldier," wrote
Washington, "requires time.... To expect the same service from raw
 and
undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
did and perhaps never will happen."

=Ho
w the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For
one thing there were delays and blunders on the 
part of the British
generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with
large bodies of regular troop
s when they might have been dealing
paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American
army. "Noth
ing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
us," solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is f
air to say that
this apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The
ministers behind them believed 
that a large part of the colonists were
loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
war 
vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds
 the quicker the
healing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were
thrown into the scale, the Am
ericans themselves had learned many things
about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were
emba
rrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage
with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfam
iliar territory. The
long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
warships of France joined the
 American privateers in preying on supply
boats.

The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war 
and
outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and
Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them final
ly that an immense army, which
could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue
the colonies if
 that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.
They learned also that America would then be alienated, fret
ful, and the
scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a
price which staggered even Lord
 North and George III. Moreover, there
were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.

=Women and t
he War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent
to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to 
the realm of
opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth
Timothee, for example, founded 
in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to
espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James
Otis, 
Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case
upon their natural rights, and in influential circl
es she urged the
leaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing
about with uncertainty at th
e Continental Congress, his wife was writing
letters to him declaring her faith in "independency."

When the war came
 down upon the country, women helped in every field. In
sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren wit
h a
tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.
Almost every revolutionary leader had a wi
fe or daughter who rendered
service in the "second line of defense." Mrs. Washington managed the
plantation while the
 General was at the front and went north to face the
rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to he
r
husband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah
Bache, while her father was pleading the America
n cause in France, set
the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even
near the firing line wo
men were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling
powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their

lives.

In the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested
crops without enjoying the picturesq
ue title of "farmerettes" and they
canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their
labor in s
pinning and weaving it is recorded: "Immediately on being cut
off from the use of English manufactures, the women eng
aged within their
own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
They thus kept their househo
lds decently clad and the surplus of their
labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
themselves. 
In this way the female part of families by their industry
and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic 
circle,
evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
service."

For their war work, women were co
mmended by high authorities on more
than one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even
as in our 
own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid
tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which
 they had
given to the cause of independence.


THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION

When the Revolution opened, there wer
e thirteen little treasuries in
America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was
in the positi
on of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority
to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred 
of the
provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
finance the war. "Do you think," bold
ly inquired one of the delegates,
"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
to the pri
nter and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will
pay for the whole?"

=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on 
this curious but appealing political
economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of
credit t
o be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. 
In all about
$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several
states added nearly $210,000,000 of 
their own notes. Then came
interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions
were also borrowed 
from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In
desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager resul
ts. The
property of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about
$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the 
states asking them to
raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened
with their own affairs, g
ave little heed.

=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it
rapidly declined in purchas
ing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by
Congress 
and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
value; but these were like attempts to make water flow up
hill.
Speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling
 on the prices of public
securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley
Forge. "Speculation,
 peculation, engrossing, forestalling," exclaimed
Washington, "afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of publ
ic
virtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency
... aided by stock jobbing and party dissens
ions has fed the hopes of
the enemy."

=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the
war wer
e added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant
of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, inclu
ding Madison,
Jefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with
money for their daily needs. All t
ogether he contributed the huge sum of
half a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,
if not 
in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia
merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the "
patriot
financier" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
the bills which poured in upon the bank
rupt government. When his own
funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the
handling of merc
handise, he created agencies at important points to
distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative
 as
well as financial talents.

[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]

Women organized "drives" for money, contributed their 
plate and their
jewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in
return for their produce, an
d soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,
the 
issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,
borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the
 Congress
staggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
next meal is to be secured but is cont
inuously relieved at a crisis by a
kindly fate.


THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION

When the full measure of honor is 
given to the soldiers and sailors and
their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and
supplies, the
 writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women
who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of reco
gnizing the
achievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was
keenly appreciated by the leaders
 in the Continental Congress. They were
fairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of
power and
 the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their
rulers. All this information they turned to good acco
unt, in opening
relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and
even military assistance. For t
he transaction of this delicate business,
they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
1775 
and prepared to send agents abroad.

=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a
friendl
y ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a
commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, 
often styled the
"first American diplomat." Later in the year a form of treaty to be
presented to foreign powers was 
drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and
Deane were selected as American representatives at the court of "His
Most Chr
istian Majesty the King of France." John Jay of New York was
chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to
 Holland the
same year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and
Berlin. The representative selected
 for St. Petersburg spent two
fruitless years there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity and
experiencing noth
ing but humiliation and failure." Frederick the Great,
king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a marke
t for
Silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,
he refused to give direct aid to the Re
volutionary cause.

=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution
was won at Paris, and Be
njamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,
although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis
XVI
's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any
American representative, had brought to the attent
ion of the king the
opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her
colonies. He showed him ho
w France could redress her grievances and
"reduce the power and greatness of England"--the empire that in 1763 had
fo
rced upon her a humiliating peace "at the price of our possessions,
of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at
 the price of Canada,
Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal." Equally successful in
gaining the king's interest
 was a curious French adventurer,
Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two
popular play
s, "Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." These two men had
already urged upon the king secret aid for America before 
Deane appeared
on the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential
arrangements to furnish money, clothing
, powder, and other supplies to
the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were
officially refused 
by the French government.

=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only
in private by the 
king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,
however, made manifest their affection for the "plain republican" in
"
his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet." He was known among
men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a
 philosopher of
extraordinary ability. His "Poor Richard" had thrice been translated
into French and was scattered in
 numerous editions throughout the
kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,
peasants, a
nd stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in
his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose he
r head in a
revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging "our dear
republican."

For the king of France
, however, this was more serious business. England
resented the presence of this "traitor" in Paris, and Louis had to
 be
cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin
's sojourn in Paris
was a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant
exploit at Trenton on Christm
as night, 1776, and the battle with
Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,
the loss
 of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement
to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York Ci
ty and
Philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson
and Delaware rivers were blocked; and Gen
eral Burgoyne with his British
troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,
cutting New England
 off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the
king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed i
n
from all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging
parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, 
surrendered on October 17,
1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to
receive the honor.


=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,
placed by historians among the fifteen decisive b
attles of the world,
reached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends
sat gloomily at dinner. B
eaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once
the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles wi
th
such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and
his ministers were at last convinced that 
the hour had come to aid the
Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
in February, 1778
. The independence of the United States was recognized
by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that indepen
dence.
Combined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally
declared war on England. Men who had, a few s
hort years before, fought
one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of
Abraham, were now ranged 
side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt
had erected and that George III was pulling down.

=Spain and Holland I
nvolved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering
the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada a
nd
hoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the
concert of nations against England. Holland, a 
member of a league of
armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high
seas, sent her fleet to u
nite with the forces of Spain, France, and
America to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England
was
 added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit
of independence was flaming up.

=The British Off
er Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be
joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord 
North
proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn
enactment, Parliament declared its intention 
not to exercise the right
of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized
the opening of negoti
ations through commissioners to be sent to America.
A truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable law
s
suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the
opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor
. It was too late. Events
had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British
commissioners and diplomats.


=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,
large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies,
 and a considerable
body of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this
help, it meant no sudden
 change in the fortunes of war. The British
evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and
Washingt
on's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They
inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but 
the treasonable
conduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of
Philadelphia was offset by the tr
eason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of
Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.

The full ef
fect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when
Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Acco
mpanied by
French troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British
to the shore while a powerful Fren
ch fleet shut off their escape by sea.
It was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed
without Fre
nch aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British
dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis a
t Yorktown that
caused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: "It is all over! It is
all over!" What might have be
en done without the French alliance lies
hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French
soldiers,
 sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the
earth. "All the world agree," exultantly wrote Franklin 
from Paris to
General Washington, "that no expedition was ever better planned or
better executed. It brightens the gl
ory that must accompany your name to
the latest posterity." Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
reward.


PEAC
E AT LAST

=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to
the final discomfiture of King Georg
e and Lord North, it is necessary to
remember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home
faced a
 powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were
vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which 
precipitated
the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,
and finally against the futile str
uggle to retain a hold upon the
American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered
against the governm
ent were the first statesmen and orators of the land.
William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of A
merican
independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
American resistance. Edmund Burke lev
eled his heavy batteries against
every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while
giving indepen
dence to America, would work for reconciliation rather
than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his gen
erous
sympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of
statesmen there were stout friends of the
 American cause like David
Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author
of wide fame and a 
republican bold enough to encourage Washington in
seeing it through.

Against this powerful opposition, the governmen
t enlisted a whole army
of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and
their friends. Dr. Samu
el Johnson, whom it employed in this business,
was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
b
efore printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in
time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline
 and Fall of the Roman
Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a
lucrative post, he used
 his sharp pen in its support, causing his
friends to ridicule him in these lines:

    "King George, in a fright
   
  Lest Gibbon should write
       The story of England's disgrace,
     Thought no way so sure
     His pen to secure

       As to give the historian a place."

=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side
of
 the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that
conquest was impossible, and they had urged the 
advantages of a peace
which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.
Every day's news confirmed
 their predictions and lent support to their
arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve
E
nglish burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses
were daily increasing. Trade with the colonie
s, the greatest single
outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due
British merchants in 
America were not only unpaid but postponed into an
indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The Fre
nch
had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in
December, 1781, that no difficulties would
 ever make him consent to a
peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on
February 27, 1782,
 in the House of Commons was carried an address to the
throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pit
t, Barre,
and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North
gave notice then that his ministry w
as at an end. The king moaned:
"Necessity made me yield."

In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English go
vernment that
it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This
was embarrassing. In the treat
y of alliance with France, the United
States had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
both natio
ns in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to
some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, 
the American
commissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without
consulting the French minister. They ac
tually signed a preliminary peace
draft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes
reproached him, 
Franklin replied that they "had been guilty of
neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work
w
ould not be ruined by a single indiscretion."

=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783

was a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the
United States, naming each state specifically, 
and agreed to boundaries
extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes
to the Floridas. Eng
land held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies
intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the 
seas.
Spain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France
gained nothing important save the satisfact
ion of seeing England humbled
and the colonies independent.

The generous terms secured by the American commission at
 Paris called
forth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way
for a renewal of commercial rela
tions with the mother country. At the
same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. "This federal
republ
ic is born a pigmy," wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal
master. "A day will come when it will be a giant; even
 a colossus
formidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility
for establishing a new population o
n immense lands, as well as the
advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans
from all the
 nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the
tyrannical existence of the same colossus."

RTH AMERICA ACCORDING TO THE TREATY OF 1783]


SUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD

The independence of the American 
colonies was foreseen by many European
statesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and
power; b
ut no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the
American colonists lived fairly happily under British
 dominion. There
were collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed
with stiff-necked colonial leg
islatures. There were protests against the
exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on
the 
whole, the relations between America and the mother country were
more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the S
tuart regime which
closed in 1688.

The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was
the produ
ct of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.
Three years before, there had come to the throne Georg
e III, a young,
proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his
predecessors, Germans as they wer
e in language and interest, had allowed
things to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would
be k
ing in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought
to a close the long and costly French and Indian 
War and was staggering
under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly
in defense of the Ameri
can colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part
 of
the cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into
prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on ta
xing America and
controlling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,
the English taxpayers were tha
nkful for any promise of relief, and
statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set
out upon
 a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated
their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforc
e the law. This
action evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act
Congress to declare their rights and
 petition for a redress of
grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,
sacked the houses of 
the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.

Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and rep
ealed
the Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of
interference. Interference again called forth Ame
rican protests.
Protests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent
over to keep order. More irrita
ting laws were passed by Parliament.
Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and
seized in the
 harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.
The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress fo
r defense. An
unexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the
spring of 1775 brought forth fr
om the king of England a proclamation:
"The Americans are rebels!"

The die was cast. The American Revolution had beg
un. Washington was made
commander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
volume of paper currency w
as issued, and foreign aid was summoned.
Franklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced
France 
to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,
Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal tr
eaty of
peace, George III acknowledged the independence of the United States.
The new nation, endowed with an imperia
l domain stretching from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the
sovereign powers of 
the earth.

In the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were
equally remarkable. Royal officers 
and royal authorities were driven
from the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.
All the colo
nies became states, each with its own constitution or plan
of government. The thirteen states were united in common b
onds under the
Articles of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.
Thus there was begun an adventu
re in popular government such as the
world had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down
and be s
upplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole continents hung upon
the answer.

PART III. THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS




CHAPTER VII

THE FORMATION OF THE CONS
TITUTION


THE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA

The rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, eac
h governed
by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by "the plain
people," was the most significant
 feature of the eighteenth century. The
majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
possible n
aturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those
Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of t
hings, saw that
the Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
constitutions, drawn by finest
 enthusiasm "uninstructed by experience,"
could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All
ar
ound them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
immediate future.

=The Weakness of the Articl
es of Confederation.=--The government under
the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources

necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.
The sole organ of government was a Congress co
mposed of from two to
seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
paid by the state. In 
determining all questions, each state had one
vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no

president to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a
committee of thirteen--one from each state--to ac
t as an executive body
when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved
a failure. There was n
o system of national courts to which citizens and
states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through w
hich
they could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,
military and financial, were withheld. C
ongress, it is true, could
authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
of contributions to
 meet its bills. It could also order the
establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply
the
ir respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring
any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the 
whole country. It
could act only through the medium of the state governments.

=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=-
-In the field of public finance,
the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was
still outst
anding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the mar
ket value of
their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The
current bills of Congress were unpa
id. As some one complained, there was
not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
the tr
ansactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter
chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congres
s had become mere
trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression
of contempt so forceful as t
he popular saying: "not worth a
Continental." To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring
new streams o
f paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in
circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coi
ns, and the
public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
clipping and filing away the metal. Fo
reign commerce was unsettled. The
entire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the
Americans, and
 Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,
was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it co
uld enforce.
Domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which
erected tariff barriers against the
ir neighbors. The condition of the
currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,
as if to i
ncrease the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering
the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an
 evil which
nothing but a national system of courts could cure.

=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naugh
t by the states, the
laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the
Congress of the United Stat
es fell into utter disrepute. It called upon
the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be
tr
eated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
futility. Some of the ablest men refused to acce
pt election to it, and
many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
Again and again it was imp
ossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
of business.

=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governme
nts, free to
pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as
many difficulties as the Congre
ss. They too were loaded with
revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
population. Oppress
ed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers o
f
several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. Th
e currency fell in
value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
old accounts.

In every par
t of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.
Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and re
enacted the
third year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
canceled by its successor. Uncertainty 
and distrust were the natural
consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
states to issue 
bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in
payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men 
heavily
in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against
creditors.

So great did the discontent of
 the farmers in New Hampshire become in
1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the
taxes a
nd the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an
armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malc
ontents, under the
leadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,
organized that same year open res
istance to the government of the state.
Shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
foreclo
sing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the
lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, aga
inst the
senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
towns on the basis of the amount of taxe
s paid, against heavy taxes, and
against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized
the towns o
f Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of
justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt 
spread,
sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
republic. Only by the most vigorous action 
was Governor Bowdoin able to
quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state
government did not da
re to execute any of the prisoners because they had
so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of th
e
legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
were defeated at the ensuing election. The
 need of national assistance
for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
emphasized by men who
 were opposed to revolutionary acts.

=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,
watching the 
drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that
the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years bef
ore was
careening into anarchy. "The facts of our peace and independence," wrote
a friend of Washington, "do not at p
resent wear so promising an
appearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,
jealousies, and turbulence
 of the people at times almost stagger my
confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to
think
 that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
which we have contended."

Washington himself was pro
foundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's
rebellion, he exclaimed: "What, gracious God, is man that there should
be 
such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the
other day that we were shedding our blood to obta
in the constitutions
under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
now we are unsheathing 
our sword to overturn them." The same year he
burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. "I am

told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
without horror. From thinking proceeds speaki
ng. Hence to acting is
often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a
triumph for our enemies t
o verify their predictions! What a triumph for
the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing

ourselves!"

ADVENTURE  I.  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

I.


To Sherlock Holmes sh
e is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predomi
nates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that 
one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfec
t reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false pos
ition. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observ
er--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusi
ons into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a d
oubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, wou
ld not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and 
that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marr
iage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up aro
und the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, whil
e Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, b
uried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug
, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and oc
cupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up th
ose mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague accou
nt of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular trag
edy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and s
uccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared wi
th all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One night--it was on the twe
ntieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when m
y way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind w
ith my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes aga
in, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked 
up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, e
agerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit,
 his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and 
was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been i
n part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word s
poken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit cas
e and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashio
n.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.
"

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in pr
actice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see
 it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy 
and careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had y
ou lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but 
as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
 given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long,
 nervous hands together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, 
just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caus
ed by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hen
ce, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boo
t-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodofor
m, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to 
show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member 
of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. 
"When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I 
could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your p
rocess. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and thr
owing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you hav
e frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hund
reds of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you
 have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.
 By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
 of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper wh
ich had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, 
and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said
, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of th
e royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importanc
e which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at
 that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do 
you imagine that it means?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly
 one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you dedu
ce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.

"The man who wrote it was p
resumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought 
under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It
 is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," an
d a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The 
name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellsch
aft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Pap
ier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelv
es. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Rem
arkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha
, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigaret
te.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note th
e peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Rus
sian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to
 discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face
. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of hors
es' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by th
e sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A
 hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

"I think that I ha
d better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be 
interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may 
he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."

A slow and heavy step, which
 had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and au
thoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in 
height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked
 upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breaste
d coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured 
at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and 
which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested
 by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face
, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his
 hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong charact
er, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.


"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would ca
ll." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This
 is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the hono
ur to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, y
our friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not,
 I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me 
back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to 
me."

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy 
for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that
 it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You wil
l excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown 
to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was a
ware of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to qu
ench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To spe
ak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."

"I was also aware of th
at," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some appa
rent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive r
easoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic cl
ient.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."


The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of des
peration, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Wh
y should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware t
hat I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of
 Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his 
high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the ma
tter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incogni
to from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.


"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the w
ell-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,"
 murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concern
ing men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish info
rmation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commande
r who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the y
ear 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! 
Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some co
mpromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secr
et marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this you
ng person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"T
here is the writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My 
photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed comm
itted an indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised yourself seriously."

"I was only Crown Prince t
hen. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We have tried and failed."

"Your Majesty must pay
. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay
 ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no 
result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But
 a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the
 photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I have heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von S
axe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is he
rself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene 
Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her,
 but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of m
en. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."

"You are sure t
hat she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when
 the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes wi
th a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Maj
esty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of
 the Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be all 
anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the p
rovinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The King took a heavy chamois leather 
bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in note
s," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.

"And Mademoiselle's add
ress?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other questi
on," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall 
soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down 
the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this littl
e matter over with you."

II.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. Th
e landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the f
ire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his in
quiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crim
es which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a chara
cter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something 
in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his s
ystem of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So a
ccustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.


It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an in
flamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the 
use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into t
he bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his poc
kets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried
, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.

"What is i
t?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I
 can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

"Quit
e so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this
 morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be 
one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a gard
en at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room 
on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window faste
ners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached fro
m the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting 
anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane
 which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in e
xchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire abou
t Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interes
ted, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned a
ll the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine
-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for d
inner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He i
s dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the 
Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-m
ews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lod
ge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the m
atter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated
 visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph 
to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue m
y work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and 
it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little di
fficulties, if you are to understand the situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balanci
ng the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably 
handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hur
ry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thorou
ghly at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitti
ng-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged
, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and loo
ked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the
 Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I wa
s just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
 with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of 
the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at 
the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' sh
e cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was j
ust balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the st
reet. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monic
a,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of co
urse it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the othe
rs were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. 
I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surplic
ed clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.
 I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three 
at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.

" 'Thank God,' he cr
ied. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

" 'What then?' I asked.

" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.
'

"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were wh
ispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of
 Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thank
ing me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposte
rous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now
. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry t
hem without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into t
he streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory 
of the occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"

"Well, I found my plans ver
y seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and e
nergetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to 
her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drov
e away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a gla
ss of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier stil
l this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaki
ng the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excel
lent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner 
has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our 
landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours 
we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Brio
ny Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There
 is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutr
al?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my
 being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station
 yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And whe
n I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the c
ry of fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped 
roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-ligh
ting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people
. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself cl
ear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then
 to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely o
n me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."

He 
disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconfor
mist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of pe
ering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes ch
anged his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. Th
e stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

It was a qu
arter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serp
entine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony 
Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' suc
cinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street 
in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing 
in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-d
ressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced 
to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged wea
pon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its
 coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"I
t is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a wom
an's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have alre
ady been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her 
lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they
 like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, bu
t she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, reme
mber that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in
 her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you look?"


"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. B
ut I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."

As he spoke the gleam of
 the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to th
e door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the 
hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce
 quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the sci
ssors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had steppe
d from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other
 with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave 
a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their
 heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the s
cuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I wil
l still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the ligh
ts of the hall, looking back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried sev
eral voices.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."


"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. The
y were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm
?"

"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"

Slowly and solemnly he
 was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post 
by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon t
he couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know
 that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I w
as conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blacke
st treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the
 smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from inj
uring another.

Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushe
d across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket
 into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well 
dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke c
urled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voic
e of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to
 the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the 
scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet stre
ets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been be
tter. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed 
me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The 
matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged
 for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm o
f my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old tric
k."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And 
into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was dete
rmined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had
 your chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her i
nstinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have mor
e than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also i
n the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now i
t was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of.
 She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerve
s of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell
-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it wa
s a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose,
 and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but
 the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance ma
y ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with
 you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable th
at when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it 
with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have 
a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I mus
t wire to the King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his poc
kets for the key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were several people on the 
pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

"I've hea
rd that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have b
een."

III.


I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when t
he King of Bohemia rushed into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shou
lder and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all im
patience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We de
scended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Y
esterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that 
she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves
 her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should in
terfere with your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen
 she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.


The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as 
we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion,
 looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to ca
ll. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock
 Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to return."


"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed in
to the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dism
antled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the 
bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The ph
otograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be lef
t till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preced
ing night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely
. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to 
think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certai
nly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even 
after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have be
en trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gi
ves. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came dow
n just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest
 to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple
 to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so y
ou will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and 
am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged
. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he mi
ght take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,



"Very truly yours,              
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bo
hemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not hav
e made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have seen of the lady, she s
eems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been 
able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the Ki
ng; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were
 in the fire."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I
 can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his h
and.

"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"
This photograph!"

The King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."


"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good mo
rning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in
 my company for his chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how 
the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of wome
n, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it
 is always under the honourable title of the woman.

ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE


I had called upon my fri
end, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, fl
orid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Hol
mes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"You could not possibly have come at a better ti
me, my dear Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can
 wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most 
successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

The stout gentleman ha
lf rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircle
d eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his c
ustom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the 
conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has promp
ted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures
."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will remember that I remarked the
 other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effe
cts and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the 
imagination."

"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must co
me round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under t
hem and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, an
d to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have
 heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the 
smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed
. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but
 the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you wou
ld have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not he
ard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail
 from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myse
lf by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit tha
t the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of som
e little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down 
the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look 
at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by hi
s dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an 
average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers,
 a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, a
nd a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wri
nkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the 
man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holm
es' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond
 the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he 
has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jab
ez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the 
name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual
 labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is qu
ite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."

"Well, the snuff, th
en, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather ag
ainst the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the 
writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the sm
ooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that you have tattooed imm
ediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and hav
e even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is 
quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes ev
en more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done s
omething clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I
 make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, 
will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," 
he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You ju
st read it for yourself, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account
 of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open wh
ich entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are 
sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'cl
ock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I 
ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as
 was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, 
off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upo
n your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Morning Chronicle of Apr
il 27, 1890. Just two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. 
Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, ne
ar the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used 
to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing 
to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holme
s.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a 
smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to giv
e him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunat
e in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this a
ge. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said
 Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his 
mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main faul
t, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He a
nd a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, fo
r I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our he
ads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he
 came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

" 'I wish to th
e Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.

" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy o
n the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that t
here are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If
 my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

" 'Why, what is it, the
n?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to
 go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
 was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-head
ed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of
 the vacancies.'

" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is sl
ight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made 
me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would hav
e been very handy.

" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see 
for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far a
s I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his wa
ys. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found tha
t he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing
 of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'

" 'B
ut,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

" 'Not so many as you might think,' he ans
wered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he w
as young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your 
hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wils
on, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sa
ke of a few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very
 full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a 
chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prov
e useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willin
g to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisemen
t.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had 
a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-he
aded folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the
 whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, 
orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-co
loured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of i
t. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and righ
t up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some 
coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."

"Your experience
 has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch o
f snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden ch
airs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words t
o each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Ge
tting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was
 much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a 
private word with us.

" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the L
eague.'

" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I
 have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt
 quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

" 'It wo
uld be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' W
ith that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,'
 said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice bee
n deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human natu
re.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groa
n of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a r
ed-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself
 one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a fami
ly?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious i
ndeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as w
ell as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at t
his, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few min
utes he said that it would be all right.

" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we 
must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your 
new duties?'

" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.

" 'Oh, never mind about that,
 Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'

" 'What would be the hours?' I 
asked.

" 'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday a
nd Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besi
des, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

" 'That would suit m
e very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

" 'Is $4 a week.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is purely nominal.'

" 'What do you ca
ll purely nominal?'

" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave
, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditio
ns if you budge from the office during that time.'

" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,
' said I.

" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There yo
u must stay, or you lose your billet.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is t
he first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table 
and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me
 congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out 
of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fort
une.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded 
myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. I
t seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anyth
ing so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by
 bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyh
ow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Po
pe's Court.

"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for 
me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he 
left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day
, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"This went on day 
after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I lef
t at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not com
e in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
 and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passe
d away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with d
iligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly f
illed a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And n
o later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little
 square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."


He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:


THE RED-HE
ADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSOLVED.

October 9, 1890.


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful 
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both 
burst out into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up t
o the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," crie
d Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the wor
ld. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny abo
ut it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know wh
at to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to t
he landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of 
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He
 answered that the name was new to him.

" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

" 'What, the red-headed man?'


" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary conv
enience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

" 'Where could I find him?'

" 'Oh, at his new o
ffices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but wh
en I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. 
William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, a
nd I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I shoul
d hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggl
e, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away
 to you."

"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy 
to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at
 first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."

"As far as you a
re personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary leagu
e. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you ha
ve gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to f
ind out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It
 was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up thes
e points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attenti
on to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an
 advertisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy 
and would come cheap."

"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-
built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon 
his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever o
bserved that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was 
a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just l
eft him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never ver
y much to do of a morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in t
he course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson
," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankl
y. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it
 proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is th
e most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"T
o smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He
 curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes c
losed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he 
had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
 who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this a
fternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing 
to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City firs
t, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which
 is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We t
ravelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the si
ngular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines o
f dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few c
lumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and
 a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed cl
ient carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over
, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to t
he corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorousl
y upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by
 a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to 
ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, clos
ing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest m
an in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.
"

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am
 sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of hi
s trousers."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, 
this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Sq
uare. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
 corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the
 back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was 
blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were bla
ck with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and sta
tely business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had jus
t quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to rem
ember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, 
the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restauran
t, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done 
our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sw
eetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

My friend wa
s an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All 
the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in tim
e to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-
hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singul
ar character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I 
have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. Th
e swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly f
ormidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter
 editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning powe
r would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him 
as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at
 St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"You wan
t to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some business t
o do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime i
s in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rat
her complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be
 at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army r
evolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

I tru
st that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dea
lings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words i
t was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole busi
ness was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extr
aordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominou
s words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were w
e going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formi
dable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter a
side until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way ac
ross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered 
the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation wit
h two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-
faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, 
buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of 
Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're
 hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man
 for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not 
prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considerable confidence in Mr.
 Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying s
o, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to s
ay that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correc
t than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Stil
l, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my 
rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you hav
e ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; 
and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smash
er, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have 
my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a 
royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet si
gns of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and b
e raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes 
on him yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also
 with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quit
e time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."

Sherlock Hol
mes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in 
the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"
We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested 
in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile i
n his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets hi
s claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in whic
h we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we
 passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, whi
ch ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which termi
nated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, ear
th-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with 
crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and ga
zed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Wh
y, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more
 quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you
 would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather per
ched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the fl
oor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few secon
ds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have at least an ho
ur before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they
 will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at
 present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more darin
g criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"It is our French gold," whisp
ered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. 
We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the B
ank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in
 our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of b
ullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgiving
s upon the subject."

"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our lit
tle plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put th
e screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocke
t, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's p
reparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our posit
ions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are c
areful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon 
them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, c
ocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
 and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal 
remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves 
worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold 
dank air of the vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Cobu
rg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the 
front door."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."

What a time it seemed! From 
comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost go
ne, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerv
es were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle 
breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, s
ighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly
 my eyes caught the glint of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened 
out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared,
 a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the h
and, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all
 was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was
 but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a sq
uare, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and w
aist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling a
fter him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

"It's all clear,"
 he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock 
Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of 
rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting c
rop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes
 blandly. "You have no chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal
 is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Ho
lmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes ans
wered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's q
uicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me w
ith your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that 
I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "

"Al
l right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab
 to carry your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to
 the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather
 as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that 
you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that h
ave ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," s
aid Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond 
that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable n
arrative of the Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over
 a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object o
f this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to
 get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing
 it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mi
nd by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who
 were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incit
es the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time t
hat I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for secu
ring the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been women in the house, I should ha
ve suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and 
there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they w
ere at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for pho
tography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made
 inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring crimi
nals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What c
ould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I 
had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was 
ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as 
I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I 
hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, a
nd stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing f
or. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had s
olved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
 directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night
?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez W
ilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it 
soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day,
 as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reas
oned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.
"

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in o
ne long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."

"And you are a
 benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," h
e remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

ADVENTURE  III. 
 A CASE OF IDENTITY


"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at 
Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to con
ceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, ho
ver over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange co
incidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leadi
ng to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stal
e and unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers ar
e, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and
 yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection and discretion mus
t be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress
 is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vita
l essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook
 my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and h
elper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that i
s strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. 
Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but 
I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, t
he push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more c
rude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing hi
s eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small point
s in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was th
at he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife,
 which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch
 of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox of old gol
d, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple l
ife that I could not help commenting upon it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is
 a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And
 the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.

"It was from the reigning fa
mily of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, 
who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"And have you any on hand just now?" I ask
ed with interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you under
stand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a fiel
d for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The 
larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In thes
e cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which p
resents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes 
are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair and was standing betwee
n the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on 
the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather 
in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this g
reat panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and fo
rward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the ban
k, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

"I have seen those symptoms before," said 
Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She wo
uld like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may disc
riminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broke
n bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, 
or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the bo
y in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure li
ke a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which
 he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and 
yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a li
ttle trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are withou
t looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear
 and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could
 you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained 
myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard
 of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. O
h, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, b
esides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."


"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his e
yes to the ceiling.

Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did b
ang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father
--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and 
kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."


"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call hi
m father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"And your mother
 is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon af
ter father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenha
m Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when M
r. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700
 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expe
cted to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had
 listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
 business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand sto
ck, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."

"You
 interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into
 the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on
 very nicely upon an income of about $60."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that
 as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am
 staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays
 it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a she
et, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said
 Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all
 about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously a
t the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets wh
en he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go
. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. B
ut this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for 
us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my pur
ple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to Fr
ance upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was
 there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very
 annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugge
d his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at
 the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that nigh
t, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, 
I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house an
y more."

"No?"

"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could h
elp it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mothe
r, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he 
make no attempt to see you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that i
t would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to w
rite every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."

"Were you engaged to
 the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. A
ngel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What office?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I
 don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No--excep
t that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office
, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerk
s about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for h
e said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the mac
hine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he wo
uld think of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are 
infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy 
man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be co
nspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands wh
en he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. 
He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses
 against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer
 Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest 
and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said 
he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the fir
st and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about fa
ther; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make 
it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was o
nly a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where t
he company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."

"It missed hi
m, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding
 was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Savio
ur's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a h
ansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to 
be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him
 to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabm
an said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last
 Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."


"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to
 leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if so
mething quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he wou
ld claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives 
a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred 
to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think tha
t what he foresaw happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more question. H
ow did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."

"And 
your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I shoul
d hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and th
en leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might
 be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, wha
t could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink
 at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into 
the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight
 of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Ang
el vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not.
"

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description
 of him and any letters of his which you can spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. 
"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwel
l."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"

"He travels for We
sthouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made your statement very cl
early. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a se
aled book, and do not allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall b
e true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, the
re was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of 
papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes
 sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and
 his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to hi
m as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up fro
m him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found 
her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases,
 if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is th
e idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."

"
You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed
, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise 
the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now
, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed str
aw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little
 black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck a
nd sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She ha
d small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-goi
ng way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming alo
ng wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but 
you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but co
ncentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first t
o take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful materia
l for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was 
beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on th
e side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at
 her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight an
d typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surp
rised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each ot
her, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was butto
ned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a
 young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deductio
n to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend'
s incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dr
essed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove a
nd finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been thi
s morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I m
ust go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held t
he little printed slip to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer
 Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centr
e, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,
 in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown 
gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"


"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Abso
lutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which w
ill no doubt strike you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Loo
k at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall 
Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."


"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say tha
t I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were institu
ted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a f
irm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here
 at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Do
ctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for 
the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energ
y in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated
 the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the 
King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, 
and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle ind
eed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when
 I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the ide
ntity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professional case of great gravity was engaging my o
wn attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close
 upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afrai
d that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however,
 half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and t
est-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical wor
k which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta
."

"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never 
any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is tha
t there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Mi
ss Sutherland?"

The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we he
ard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," sai
d Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"

The man who entered was a sturdy, mid
dle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a
 pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny to
p-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windiba
nk," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six
 o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry th
at Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the s
ort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may 
have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind yo
u so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like
 this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the c
ontrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."


Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious t
hing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they
 are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
 side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of
 the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the mor
e obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our vi
sitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show you what is really a ver
y interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these day
s on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have 
here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are th
e 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourtee
n other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked
 up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, 
catch him, and let me know when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in th
e door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his l
ips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is 
no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you 
said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

O
ur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionabl
e," he stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfi
sh and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and y
ou will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like 
one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hand
s in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"The man married a woman very much old
er than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived wi
th them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious differ
ence. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and wa
rm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she wou
ld not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so wha
t does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek
 the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insi
sted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever s
tepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assist
ance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache 
and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the 
girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only
 a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."

"Very likely no
t. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her s
tepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the g
entleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel 
began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be 
produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towar
ds anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbro
us. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a perma
nent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. 
Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something hap
pening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and
 so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as
 the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick 
of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windiban
k!"

Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair n
ow with a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very
 sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done noth
ing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assaul
t and illegal constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the doo
r, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to 
lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's
 face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat mys
elf to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon th
e stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his 
speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his ch
air once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. Th
e case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of you
r reasoning," I remarked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some s
trong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident,
 as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one alw
ays appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both
 hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewrit
ing his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise ev
en the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the sam
e direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew 
the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could
 be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that th
ey would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the pecul
iarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. 
As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brou
ght me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect w
ith that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe
 me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for 
whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the w
orld."

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY


We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the 
maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:

"Have you a couple of days to spare? Ha
ve just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will
 come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."

"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looki
ng across at me. "Will you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."

"Oh, Anstr
uther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you go
od, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing w
hat I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.
"

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. M
y wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Pad
dington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and ta
ller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of you to come, Watson,"
 said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid 
is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."

We had t
he carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rumma
ged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled th
em all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"Not
 a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."

"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been 
looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of 
those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly tru
e. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is
 to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered m
an."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the o
pportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to un
derstand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. T
he largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some yea
rs ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who wa
s also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they ca
me to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy
 became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. Mc
Carthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives
 living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, 
though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCa
rthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is 
as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, 
McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a sm
all lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serv
ing-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to
 keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.

"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a 
quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not ment
ioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that
 Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he ha
d seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the fathe
r was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard i
n the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, th
e game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reed
s round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley 
estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wo
od and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard 
Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strik
e his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home tha
t she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to figh
t. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his fa
ther dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or hi
s hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the de
ad body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and
 blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which 
was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly ar
rested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought 
before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case 
as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked.
 "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."

"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky 
thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own poi
nt of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It
 must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible tha
t he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the d
aughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may rec
ollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled,
 has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an ho
ur instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious tha
t you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,
" he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means
 obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or 
destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first exa
mple to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question
 whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I k
now you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you s
have by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until
 it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less 
illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being s
atisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my met
ier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one 
or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It a
ppears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of consta
bulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no mor
e than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have r
emained in the minds of the coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a pro
testation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious re
mark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However i
nnocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black a
gainst him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it a
s highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appea
r to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man,
 or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not un
natural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that
 very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose e
vidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed 
in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many me
n have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.

"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."


"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, t
hough there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."


He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed ou
t the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself
 down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, the only so
n of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol
, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of 
my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after m
y return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidl
y out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the
 direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my
 way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I 
was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a
 cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standin
g by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A co
nversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seei
ng that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more th
an 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father 
expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost ins
tantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house bei
ng the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by
 his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I k
now, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to y
ou before he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.

"The Coroner: W
hat did you understand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.

"The Coron
er: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answe
r.

"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assu
re you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide.
 I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedi
ngs which may arise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common
 signal between you and your father?

"Witness: It was.

"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he
 saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do n
ot know.

"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and foun
d your father fatally injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Coroner: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so dist
urbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vagu
e impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something g
rey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was 
gone.

" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" 'Yes, it was gone.'

" 'You cannot say what i
t was?'

" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

" 'How far from the body?'

" 'A dozen yards or so.'

" 'And h
ow far from the edge of the wood?'

" 'About the same.'

" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a doz
en yards of it?'

" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded the examination of the witness."

"I see," s
aid I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy
. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him,
 also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dy
ing words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."

Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched h
imself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the v
ery strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too muc
h imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy
 of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a ra
t, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this
 young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, a
nd not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that
 we shall be there in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautif
ul Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A le
an, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustc
oat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Le
strade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

"I ha
ve ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would 
not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answ
ered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said
.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here wh
ich need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it i
s probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already forme
d your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it
 the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard 
of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I h
ad not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed
 into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips
 parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and con
cern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick 
intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know t
hat James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt u
pon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; bu
t he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may cl
ear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."

"But you have read the evi
dence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is
 innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiant
ly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has b
een a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never 
did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coron
er was because I was concerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide anything. James a
nd his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between 
us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very littl
e of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and th
is, I am sure, was one of them."

"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"

"No, he was a
verse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Hol
mes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your fat
her if I call to-morrow?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The doctor?"

"Yes, have you not heard? Poor fa
ther has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. 
Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had
 known dad in the old days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at 
the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."

"Yes, certainly."

"Thank you, Miss Turner. You 
have been of material assistance to me."

"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to t
he prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner
."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your 
undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage ra
ttle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "W
hy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."


"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"

"Yes
, but only for you and me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a tra
in to Hereford and see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, 
but I shall only be away a couple of hours."

I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the s
treets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in 
a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through whi
ch we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung 
it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhap
py young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary cala
mity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his scre
ams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the in
juries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contai
ned a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
 parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I mark
ed the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favou
r of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, f
or the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' atte
ntion to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A 
man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain h
ow he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the
 incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his
 dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the
 instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improba
bilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes'
 insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy
's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings 
in the town.

"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should not 
rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for su
ch nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."

"And w
hat did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was inclined to think at one ti
me that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyon
e else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."

"I canno
t admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young la
dy as this Miss Turner."

"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her,
 but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a
 boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registr
y office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for 
not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy 
of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him
 on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by a
ll accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife 
that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of
 importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious troub
le and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already 
in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled youn
g McCarthy for all that he has suffered."

"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"

"Ah! who? I would call your att
ention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and
 that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The se
cond is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the cruci
al points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave a
ll minor matters until to-morrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloud
less. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Po
ol.

"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill tha
t his life is despaired of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his constitution has been 
shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effec
t upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he
 gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."

"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways 
he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."

"Really! Does it not strike you as a little 
singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Tu
rner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that
 in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more 
strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce so
mething from that?"

"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it har
d enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."

"You are right," said Holmes demu
rely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."

"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it dif
ficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.

"And that is--"

"That McCarthy senior met his death from
 McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."

"Well, moonshine is a brighter thi
ng than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left."

"Yes
, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotch
es of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as t
hough the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes' request, sh
owed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair w
hich he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be
 led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.

Sherlock Holmes was
 transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Bake
r Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black 
lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bo
wed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dila
te with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him th
at a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply
. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to t
he Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon t
he path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dea
d, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferen
t and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of hi
s actions was directed towards a definite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fi
fty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turn
er. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the sit
e of the rich landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narr
ow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrad
e showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plain
ly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face an
d peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picki
ng up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.

"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.

"I fished about wi
th a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--"

"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! T
hat left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes amon
g the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallow
ed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight
 feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his 
waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet
. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. Th
at bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father's feet as he paced up a
nd down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we
 here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was fo
r the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until w
e were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.
 Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfac
tion. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to 
be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he c
ould reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he follow
ed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.

"It has been a case of cons
iderable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on the right must be 
the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, w
e may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."

It was about ten minu
tes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked
 up in the wood.

"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder was done with it."

"I 
see no marks."

"There are none."

"How do you know, then?"

"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there 
a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign
 of any other weapon."

"And the murderer?"

"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled
 shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his poc
ket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."

Lestrade laughed. "I am 
afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed Briti
sh jury."

"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy 
this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."

"And leave your case unfinished?"

"No, f
inished."

"But the mystery?"

"It is solved."

"Who was the criminal, then?"

"The gentleman I describe."

"But who 
is he?"

"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."

Lestrade shrugge
d his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for 
a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."

"All right," said Hol
mes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."


Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent an
d buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.

"Look
 here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little
. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound."

"Pray do so."

"
Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instan
tly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according
 to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled seve
ral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double point our research must c
ommence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."

"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"


"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere 
chance that he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the 
appointment with. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a s
trong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Aus
tralia."

"What of the rat, then?"

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the t
able. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand ove
r part of the map. "What do you read?"

"ARAT," I read.

"And now?" He raised his hand.

"BALLARAT."

"Quite so. That
 was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the na
me of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."

"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.

"It is obvious. And now, you see, I ha
d narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's 
statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Aus
tralian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."

"Certainly."

"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can o
nly be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."

"Quite so."

"Then comes our e
xpedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lest
rade, as to the personality of the criminal."

"But how did you gain them?"

"You know my method. It is founded upon 
the observation of trifles."

"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boot
s, too, might be told from their traces."

"Yes, they were peculiar boots."

"But his lameness?"

"The impression of 
his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lam
e."

"But his left-handedness."

"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at 
the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless
 it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had 
even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as
 an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of
 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discove
red the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotte
rdam."

"And the cigar-holder?"

"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The
 tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."

"Holmes," I
 said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as
 truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is
--"

"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

The
 man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance 
of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of
 unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows comb
ined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and th
e corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of
 some deadly and chronic disease.

"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my note?"

"Yes, the lod
ge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."

"I thought people would talk if 
I went to the Hall."

"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary ey
es, as though his question was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It i
s so. I know all about McCarthy."

The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not 
have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the As
sizes."

"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear g
irl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."

"It may not come to that,
" said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence her
e, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."

"I am a dying man," said old Turner. 
"I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die 
under my own roof than in a gaol."

Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of pa
per before him. "Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can
 witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I 
shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."

"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I shall
 live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the
 thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.

"You didn't know this
 dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
 His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in hi
s power.

"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to tur
n my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in
 a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of 
it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballar
at was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.

"One day a gold 
convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and s
ix of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were k
illed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCart
hy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my fa
ce, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to Engl
and without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable
 life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, t
o make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear lit
tle Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever 
done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy l
aid his grip upon me.

"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat 
to his back or a boot to his foot.

" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a fa
mily to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine, law-abi
ding country is England, and there's always a policeman within hail.'

"Well, down they came to the west country, the
re was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me,
 no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as A
lice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must
 have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I c
ould not give. He asked for Alice.

"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in 
weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I
 would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, an
d that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midwa
y between our houses to talk it over.

"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar 
and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me 
seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think a
s if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in
 the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear 
of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved
 if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have 
led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was mo
re than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. 
His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the clo
ak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."

"Well, it is not for 
me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never
 be exposed to such a temptation."

"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"

"In view of your health, nothin
g. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will 
keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mor
tal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."

"Farewell, then," said the old man s
olemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to
 mine." Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.

"God help us!" said Holmes a
fter a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this t
hat I do not think of Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.' "

James McCa
rthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and su
bmitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and ther
e is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which
 rests upon their past.

ADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS


When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherloc
k Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features th
at it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity thro
ugh the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high
 a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, an
d would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have th
eir explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to 
him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that
 I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never
 have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.

The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases o
f greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an a
ccount of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lo
wer vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the
 singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In t
he latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had b
een wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which wa
s of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of the
m present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.


It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the 
wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made Lon
don we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those
 great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. 
As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sher
lock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was de
ep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, 
and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother
's, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.

"Why," said I, glancing up at m
y companion, "that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"

"Except yourself I 
have none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."

"A client, then?"

"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing les
s would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of t
he landlady's."

Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tap
ping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon 
which a newcomer must sit.

"Come in!" said he.

The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, w
ell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which h
e held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked a
bout him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of
 a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
 his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your s
nug chamber."

"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook and will be dry present
ly. You have come up from the south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Horsham."

"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upo
n your toe caps is quite distinctive."

"I have come for advice."

"That is easily got."

"And help."

"That is not a
lways so easy."

"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankervill
e Club scandal."

"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."

"He said that you could solve any
thing."

"He said too much."

"That you are never beaten."

"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and o
nce by a woman."

"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"

"It is true that I have been genera
lly successful."

"Then you may be so with me."

"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me wi
th some details as to your case."

"It is no ordinary one."

"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court
 of appeal."

"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious 
and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family."

"You fill me with interest," said
 Holmes. "Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those detai
ls which seem to me to be most important."

The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the
 blaze.

"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do wit
h this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the
 commencement of the affair.

"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. M
y father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a paten
tee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retir
e upon a handsome competence.

"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in F
lorida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army, and afterwa
rds under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where
 he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, ne
ar Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion t
o the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fi
erce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the year
s that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round hi
s house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He d
rank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not ev
en his own brother.

"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a
 youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begg
ed my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of p
laying backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the t
radespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go
 where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception
, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he wou
ld never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I wa
s never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.

"One 
day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was 
not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of a
ny sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out 
there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the lau
gh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colou
r of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and the
n, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'

" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.

" 'Death,' said he, and rising from
 the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red
 ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five
 dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the s
tair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small bra
ss box, like a cashbox, in the other.

" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an
 oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'

"I did 
as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in 
the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty besid
e it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in
 the morning upon the envelope.

" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with al
l its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If 
you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadli
est enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are going to take. Kindly 
sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'

"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. 
The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it ev
ery way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread wh
ich it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual
 routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined f
or any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but someti
mes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a rev
olver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a
 pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and
 bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul
. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a 
basin.

"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when h
e made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face
 downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and
 the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 
'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had 
gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and 
of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."

"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I forese
e, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of t
he letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."

"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks l
ater, upon the night of May 2nd."

"Thank you. Pray proceed."

"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at
 my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, 
although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K.
 repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated t
he nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importa
nce in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some of t
hem were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Other
s were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he ha
d evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.

"Well,
 it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until t
he January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat toge
ther at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pip
s in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the
 colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.

" 'Why, what on earth
 does this mean, John?' he stammered.

"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.

"He looked inside the
 envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?'

" 'Put the papers
 on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.

" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.

" 'The sundial in the
 garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'

" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping 
hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thin
g come from?'

" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.

" 'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he.
 'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.'

" 'I should certainly speak 
to the police,' I said.

" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'

" 'Then let me do so?'

" 'No, I f
orbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'

"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obsti
nate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.

"On the third day after the coming of t
he letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the for
ts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was
 away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the 
major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbo
urhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever rec
overed his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was 
unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accide
ntal causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could 
suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having 
been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh cer
tain that some foul plot had been woven round him.

"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me
 why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upo
n an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.

"It was in Ja
nuary, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time
 I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that i
t had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell 
in the very shape in which it had come upon my father."

The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, a
nd turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.

"This is the envelope," he continued. "T
he postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K
.'; and then 'Put the papers on the sundial.' "

"What have you done?" asked Holmes.

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"To tel
l the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor 
rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which n
o foresight and no precautions can guard against."

"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are
 lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."

"I have seen the police."

"Ah!"

"But they li
stened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all pr
actical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be conn
ected with the warnings."

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!" he cried.

"They have
, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."

"Has he come with you to-night?"

"No. His 
orders were to stay in the house."

Again Holmes raved in the air.

"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above a
ll, why did you not come at once?"

"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my tr
oubles and was advised by him to come to you."

"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted
 before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detai
l which might help us?"

"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a
 piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance," said he, "that on
 the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of
 this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may
 be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destructio
n. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private
 diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."

Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, whi
ch showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were
 the following enigmatical notices:

"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.

"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore,
 and

        John Swain, of St. Augustine.

"9th. McCauley cleared.

"10th. John Swain cleared.

"12th. Visited Para
more. All well."

"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you must o
n no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home inst
antly and act."

"What shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece 
of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that
 all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in
 such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, 
as directed. Do you understand?"

"Entirely."

"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think
 that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first co
nsideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish
 the guilty parties."

"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "You have given me fres
h life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."

"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself
 in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent d
anger. How do you go back?"

"By train from Waterloo."

"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust 
that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."

"I am armed."

"That is well. To-morrow I
 shall set to work upon your case."

"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"

"No, your secret lies in London. It is ther
e that I shall seek it."

"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the paper
s. I shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still s
creamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us fr
om amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by the
m once more.

Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red
 glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased
 each other up to the ceiling.

"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more 
fantastic than this."

"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."

"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Opensha
w seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos."

"But have you," I asked, "formed any def
inite conception as to what these perils are?"

"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.

"Then wh
at are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"

Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and 
placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "woul
d, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events whi
ch led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole anima
l by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incide
nts should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results
 which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have soug
ht a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the r
easoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you 
will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a
 somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is lik
ely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one 
occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."

"Yes," I answered, laug
hing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variab
le, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anato
my unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-p
oisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."

Holmes grinned at the last ite
m. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the fu
rniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it
 if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
 all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside
 you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may st
art with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time 
of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of 
an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone 
or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from 
America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were receiv
ed by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"

"The first was from Pondicherry, t
he second from Dundee, and the third from London."

"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"

"They are all 
seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."

"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that th
e probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another poi
nt. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some
 three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"

"A greater distance to travel."

"But the letter had also a greate
r distance to come."

"Then I do not see the point."

"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the m
an or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when sta
rting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come f
rom Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven 
weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the lett
er and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."

"It is possible."

"More than that. It is probable. And now you
 see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at th
e end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefo
re we cannot count upon delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?"

"The papers w
hich Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it
 is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such 
a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and
 determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases
 to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society."

"But of what society?"

"Have you never--"
 said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

"I never h
ave."

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently:

" 'Ku Klux Klan. A 
name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was
 formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branc
hes in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its powe
r was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving 
from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the 
marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or oran
ge pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the cou
ntry. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen 
manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case up
on record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to th
e perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government an
d of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly col
lapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'

"You will observe," said Holm
es, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Open
shaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family h
ave some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implica
te some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recove
red."

"Then the page we have seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent the pips to A,
 B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or l
eft the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that w
e may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is t
o do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let
 us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men."

It ha
d cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
 great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.

"You will excuse me for not waiting for you,
" said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's."

"What steps
 will you take?" I asked.

"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to
 Horsham, after all."

"You will not go there first?"

"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and th
e maid will bring up your coffee."

As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye ov
er it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.

"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."

"Ah!" said h
e, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply move
d.

"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:

" 'Bet
ween nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for 
help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of s
everal passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the 
water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears 
from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conject
ured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the
 extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats
. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unf
ortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the r
iverside landing-stages.' "

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever see
n him.

"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It b
ecomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should
 come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair and paced about the r
oom in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his lon
g thin hands.

"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they have decoyed him down there? The 
Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for
 their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"

"To the police?"

"No;
 I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before."

All day I was engaged 
in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not co
me back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and t
earing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.

"You are hung
ry," I remarked.

"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast."

"Nothing?"

"Not a bite.
 I had no time to think of it."

"And how have you succeeded?"

"Well."

"You have a clue?"

"I have them in the holl
ow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark 
upon them. It is well thought of!"

"What do you mean?"

He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to piece
s he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of t
he flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Sa
vannah, Georgia."

"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night.
 He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."

"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"

"T
he leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."

"How did you trace it, then?"

He took a large sheet 
of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.

"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's reg
isters and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in Janua
ry and February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of
 these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from 
London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union."

"Texas, I think."

"I was not and am not
 sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin."

"What then?"

"I searched the Dundee records, a
nd when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired
 as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London."

"Yes?"

"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I
 went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homewa
rd bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly
 I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."

"What will you do, then
?"

"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. T
he others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from 
the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat wi
ll have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are b
adly wanted here upon a charge of murder."

There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the m
urderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as
 resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We wai
ted long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out 
in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." 
carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.

ADVENTURE  VI.  THE MAN WITH 
THE TWISTED LIP


Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. G
eorge's, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at
 college; for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with lau
danum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to 
attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and
 pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, 
all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.

One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my b
ell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid 
her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.

"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go 
out."

I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then 
quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black vei
l, entered the room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, sh
e ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" she crie
d; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me,
 Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in."

"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That
 was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.

"It was very sweet of you t
o come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rath
er that I sent James off to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not 
been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!"

It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her hu
sband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by
 such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her
?

It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an 
opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come 
back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay 
there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to b
e found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a youn
g and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded hi
m?

There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then
, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, and as such I had influence o
ver him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab with
in two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair an
d cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the
 time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.

But there was no great difficulty in the first st
age of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of 
the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps lea
ding down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait,
 I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a fli
ckering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the bro
wn opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.

Through the gloom one coul
d dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, a
nd chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shad
ows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the b
owls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strang
e, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbl
ing out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier
 of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw restin
g upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.

As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant h
ad hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

"Thank you. I have not co
me to stay," said I. "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."

There was a mo
vement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, st
aring out at me.

"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitt
er. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"

"Nearly eleven."

"Of what day?"

"Of Friday, June 19th."

"Good heavens! I
 thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms a
nd began to sob in a high treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days f
or you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few 
hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little K
ate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"

"Yes, I have one waiting."

"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe somethin
g. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."

I walked down the narrow passage betw
een the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking abo
ut for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voic
e whispered, "Walk past me, and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. T
hey could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkle
d, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude fro
m his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out 
into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wri
nkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, w
as none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his fa
ce half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispered, "wh
at on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have 
the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
 you."

"I have a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too l
imp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you h
ave thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."

It was difficult to 
refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a qu
iet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomp
lished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singu
lar adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney
's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had
 emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled alon
g with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a 
hearty fit of laughter.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine i
njections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views."

"I was certai
nly surprised to find you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."

"I came to find a friend."

"And I to find 
an enemy."

"An enemy?"

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in 
the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as
 I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase; for 
I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon m
e. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange 
tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"

"Ay, bodies, Watson.
 We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest 
murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our 
trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered 
by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.

"No
w, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow li
ght from its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"

"If I can be of use."

"Oh, a trusty comrade is always
 of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."

"The Cedars?"

"Yes; that is
 Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry."

"Where is it, then?"

"Near Lee, in Kent. W
e have a seven-mile drive before us."

"But I am all in the dark."

"Of course you are. You'll know all about it pres
ently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about el
even. Give her her head. So long, then!"

He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless 
succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded b
ridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, i
ts silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party
 of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there throu
gh the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is 
lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers
 so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginn
ing to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up hi
s pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.

"You have a grand gift of sil
ence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to ha
ve someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear litt
le woman to-night when she meets me at the door."

"You forget that I know nothing about it."

"I shall just have tim
e to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothin
g to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the cas
e clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."

"Proceed, then."

"S
ome years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared t
o have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. B
y degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now
 has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the 
morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a m
an of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I
 may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., wh
ile he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that
 money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.

"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier t
han usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his 
little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very 
shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was
 waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will kn
ow that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me t
o-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, go
t her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you
 followed me so far?"

"It is very clear."

"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair w
alked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found he
rself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck 
cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. Th
e window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hand
s frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked ba
ck by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although h
e wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.

"Convinced that some
thing was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you fou
nd me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. A
t the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aide
d by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and f
ears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspect
or, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued res
istance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no si
gn of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous a
spect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the fron
t room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to 
believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the tabl
e and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to br
ing home.

"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the m
atter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room 
was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wh
arves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high ti
de with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examinat
ion traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden flo
or of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with
 the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There were no signs of viol
ence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must a
pparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little prom
ise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.

"And 
now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the
 vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a v
ery few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the cr
ime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Bo
one, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.

"So m
uch for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who wa
s certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous fa
ce is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to a
void the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street
, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creatu
re takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a s
mall rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the
 fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at th
e harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him wit
hout observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
 turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a
 singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, 
does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. T
his is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the g
entleman of whom we are in quest."

"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed against a man in 
the prime of life?"

"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be 
a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is
 often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."

"Pray continue your narrative."

"Mrs. St. Clair had 
fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence 
could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very carefu
l examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had be
en made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated 
with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being 
found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he poin
ted to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding tha
t he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from th
e same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothe
s in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually s
een her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly pro
testing, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might
 afford some fresh clue.

"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It wa
s Neville St. Clair's coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think
 they found in the pockets?"

"I cannot imagine."

"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with penn
ies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide.
 But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely eno
ugh that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river."

"But I understa
nd that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"

"No, sir, but the 
facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, th
ere is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him th
at he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, wh
en it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs
 when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the polic
e are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumu
lated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make
 sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard 
the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."

"It certainly sounds 
feasible."

"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arres
ted and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had 
for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. Ther
e the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the op
ium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are 
all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the 
first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."

While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this sin
gular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses
 had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however
, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.

"We are on the outskir
ts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, 
passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside t
hat lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"
But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be
 made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will h
ave nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband
. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A 
stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive 
which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in
 some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with he
r figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slig
htly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.

"Well?" she cried, "we
ll?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my co
mpanion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"None."

"No bad?"

"No."

"Thank God for that. 
But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day."

"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vi
tal use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate h
im with this investigation."

"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, f
orgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon u
s."

"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is neede
d. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy."

"Now, Mr. Sherlock H
olmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, 
"I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer."

"
Certainly, madam."

"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to h
ear your real, real opinion."

"Upon what point?"

"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"

Sh
erlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looki
ng keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."

"You think that he is 
dead?"

"I do."

"Murdered?"

"I don't say that. Perhaps."

"And on what day did he meet his death?"

"On Monday."

"
Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.
"

Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.

"What!" he roared.

"Yes, to-day." She stoo
d smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.

"May I see it?"

"Certainly."

He snatched it from her in h
is eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair
 and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postma
rk and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.

"Coarse 
writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."

"No, but the enclosure is."

"I perce
ive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address."

"How can you tell that?"

"Th
e name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows th
at blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black
 shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only me
an that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us
 now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"

"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."

"And you are 
sure that this is your husband's hand?"

"One of his hands."

"One?"

"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very u
nlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well."

" 'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a hu
ge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-l
eaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the f
lap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt 
that it is your husband's hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words."

"And they were posted to-day at Gravesen
d. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over."

"But he mu
st be alive, Mr. Holmes."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves
 nothing. It may have been taken from him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"

"Very well. It may, howeve
r, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day."

"That is possible."

"If so, much may have happened between.
"

"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between
 us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and 
yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you thin
k that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"

"I have seen too much not to know that th
e impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you ce
rtainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write
 letters, why should he remain away from you?"

"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."

"And on Monday he made no rem
arks before leaving you?"

"No."

"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"

"Very much so."

"Was the win
dow open?"

"Yes."

"Then he might have called to you?"

"He might."

"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate
 cry?"

"Yes."

"A call for help, you thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hands."

"But it might have been a cry of surpris
e. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"

"It is possible."

"And you t
hought he was pulled back?"

"He disappeared so suddenly."

"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else i
n the room?"

"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs
."

"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"

"But without his collar or tie. 
I distinctly saw his bare throat."

"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"

"Never."

"Had he ever showed any signs of
 having taken opium?"

"Never."

"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to b
e absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow."

A
 large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for 
I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upo
n his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at 
it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It 
was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on
 a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the s
ofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, wit
h an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitt
ing there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke
 curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as 
I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shin
ing into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of 
a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.

"Awake, Wat
son?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Game for a morning drive?"

"Certainly."

"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know w
here the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkl
ed, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.

As I dressed I glanced at my watch. I
t was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes ret
urned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.

"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pullin
g on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Euro
pe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now."

"And where is 
it?" I asked, smiling.

"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of i
ncredulity. "I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my bo
y, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."

We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out in
to the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the he
ad. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetab
les to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.

"
It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have
 been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."

In town the earliest
 risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. P
assing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to t
he right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at th
e door saluted him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.

"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.

"I
nspector Bradstreet, sir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged pas
sage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr. Holmes.
 Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projec
ting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"

"I called about that b
eggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."


"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."

"So I heard. You have him here?"

"In the cells."

"I
s he quiet?"

"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."

"Dirty?"

"Yes, it is all we can do to make hi
m wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a r
egular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."

"I should like to see h
im very much."

"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag."

"No, I think that I'll take
 it."

"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a windi
ng stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.

"The third on the right is his
," said the inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.


"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."

We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with hi
s face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as be
came his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector ha
d said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal
 from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper li
p, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and 
forehead.

"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.

"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an id
ea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and
 took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.

"No
w, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respecta
ble figure."

"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells, do
es he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then
 settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed i
t twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.

"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clai
r, of Lee, in the county of Kent."

Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sp
onge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it ac
ross, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair
, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubb
ing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a sc
ream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.

"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the m
issing man. I know him from the photograph."

The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself
 to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"

"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh
, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a
 grin. "Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."

"If I am Mr. Neville St.
 Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained."

"No crim
e, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."

"
It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their
 father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"

Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him k
indly on the shoulder.

"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardl
y avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against y
ou, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstre
et would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The ca
se would then never go into court at all."

"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have endured i
mprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.

"You are
 the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent 
education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. O
ne day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them
. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could 
get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, a
nd had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to 
make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small 
slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the busi
ness part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and whe
n I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.

"I wrote my articl
es and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served u
pon me for $25. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's gr
ace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disg
uise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.

"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to ar
duous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, layin
g my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at
 last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my gh
astly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which 
I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform
 myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew 
that my secret was safe in his possession.

"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I 
do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--b
ut I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by pract
ice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in up
on me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take $2.

"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house
 in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife kne
w that I had business in the City. She little knew what.

"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in
 my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was 
standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face
, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice d
ownstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put
 on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that 
there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my v
iolence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was w
eighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurle
d it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment
 there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that 
instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.

"I do not know that there is a
nything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference
 for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lasca
r at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
 fear."

"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.

"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"

"The pol
ice have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult
 to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some 
days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted f
or begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police
 are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."

"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a 
man can take."

"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found ag
ain, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matt
er up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillow
s and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for brea
kfast."

VII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE


I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morn
ing after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa i
n a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evident
ly newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy a
nd disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upo
n the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.

"Yo
u are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."

"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss m
y results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there ar
e points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction."

I seated myself i
n his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thic
k with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked 
on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."


"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen
 when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the act
ion and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place,
 and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have alread
y had experience of such."

"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, thr
ee have been entirely free of any legal crime."

"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler pape
rs, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have 
no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"

"
Yes."

"It is to him that this trophy belongs."

"It is his hat."

"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg 
that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came 
here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at thi
s moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as
 you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down 
Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carr
ying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this s
tranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to def
end himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protec
t the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking 
person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small
 streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so th
at he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered 
hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."

"Which surely he restored to their owner?"

"My dear fellow, there li
es the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's lef
t leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some t
housands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property t
o any one of them."

"What, then, did Peterson do?"

"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
 knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there 
were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. It
s finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat
 of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner."

"Did he not advertise?"

"No."

"Then, what clue could you
 have as to his identity?"

"Only as much as we can deduce."

"From his hat?"

"Precisely."

"But you are joking. Wha
t can you gather from this old battered felt?"

"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself a
s to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?"

I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it o
ver rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The
 lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked
, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was
 missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to ha
ve been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.

"I can see nothing," said I, handing
 it back to my friend.

"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you 
see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."

"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?
"

He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perh
aps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinc
t, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is
 of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although 
he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression
, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work 
upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."

"My dear Holmes!"

"He h
as, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who lead
s a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had 
cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be d
educed from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."

"You a
re certainly joking, Holmes."

"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you ar
e unable to see how they are attained?"

"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable 
to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"

For answer Holmes clapped the hat up
on his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a question of cubic capa
city," said he; "a man with so large a brain must have something in it."

"The decline of his fortunes, then?"

"This
 hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look
 at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years 
ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."

"Well, that is clear enough, certainly
. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"

Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said h
e putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this man or
dered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution agains
t the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he
 has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has end
eavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not enti
rely lost his self-respect."

"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."

"The further points, that he is middle-aged, 
that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a 
close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the s
cissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you wi
ll observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has be
en hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer p
erspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training."

"But his wife--you said that she had 
ceased to love him."

"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumul
ation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have
 been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."

"But he might be a bachelor."

"Nay, he was bringing home t
he goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."

"You have an answer to everything.
 But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"

"One tallow stain, or even two, might com
e by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be bro
ught into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a gutte
ring candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"

"Well, it is very i
ngenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done sa
ve the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."

Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to repl
y, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the f
ace of a man who is dazed with astonishment.

"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.

"Eh? What of it, t
hen? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa 
to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.

"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out his
 hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in
 size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.

Sherl
ock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know wh
at you have got?"

"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty."

"It's more than a
 precious stone. It is the precious stone."

"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.

"Precisely
 so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day la
tely. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly no
t within a twentieth part of the market price."

"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped
 down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.

"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there
 are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if sh
e could but recover the gem."

"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.

"Precisel
y so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady
's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some acc
ount of the matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoot
hed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:

"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, 
plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess
 of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence
 to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery
 in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little 
time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been 
forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to 
keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the 
same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the 
Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the roo
m, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to th
e arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a prev
ious conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the
 offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fain
ted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."

"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfu
lly, tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel
-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions 
have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goos
e, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with whi
ch I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part
 he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in
 an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."

"What will you s
ay?"

"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black
 felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear a
nd concise."

"Very. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the 
loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterso
n that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him 
to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will
 direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the even
ing papers."

"In which, sir?"

"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and an
y others that occur to you."

"Very well, sir. And this stone?"

"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I 
say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gent
leman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."

When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the 
stone and held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course i
t is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewel
s every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the A
moy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue i
n shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
 vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystall
ised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it u
p in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."

"Do you think that this man Horner i
s innocent?"

"I cannot tell."

"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with
 the matter?"

"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that
 the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I s
hall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."

"And you can do nothing until then?
"

"Nothing."

"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour
 you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."

"Very glad to see you. I dine 
at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Huds
on to examine its crop."

I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself i
n Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttone
d up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the d
oor was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.

"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from hi
s armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "Pray take this 
chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than
 for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"

"Yes, sir, that is undo
ubtedly my hat."

He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping d
own to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended han
d, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the col
lar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow sta
ccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who h
ad had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.

"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we ex
pected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."


Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were," he rema
rked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not ca
re to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."

"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we we
re compelled to eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.

"Yes, it would have b
een of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about th
e same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"

"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. 
Baker with a sigh of relief.

"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if y
ou wish--"

The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he, "but 
beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I t
hink that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboa
rd."

Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.

"There is your hat, then, a
nd there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewh
at of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose."

"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and 
tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--w
e are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, in
stituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Chr
istmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet
 is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us an
d strode off upon his way.

"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "It is
 quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"

"Not particularly."

"Then 
I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."

"By all means."

It 
was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining 
coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfa
lls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so throu
gh Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a smal
l public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the p
rivate bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

"Your beer should be excell
ent if it is as good as your geese," said he.

"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.

"Yes. I was speaking only half 
an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."

"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not 
our geese."

"Indeed! Whose, then?"

"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."

"Indeed? I know s
ome of them. Which was it?"

"Breckinridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlo
rd, and prosperity to your house. Good-night."

"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we
 came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this 
chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his inn
ocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation 
which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the
 bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!"

We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so throug
h a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the
 proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.


"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.

The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.


"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.

"Let you have five hundred to-m
orrow morning."

"That's no good."

"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."

"Ah, but I was recommend
ed to you."

"Who by?"

"The landlord of the Alpha."

"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."

"Fine birds they were
, too. Now where did you get them from?"

To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.

"
Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straig
ht, now."

"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha."

"W
ell then, I shan't tell you. So now!"

"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so wa
rm over such a trifle."

"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a
 good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese
 to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss
 that is made over them."

"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries," said Ho
lmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matt
er of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred."

"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for
 it's town bred," snapped the salesman.

"It's nothing of the kind."

"I say it is."

"I don't believe it."

"D'you t
hink you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds t
hat went to the Alpha were town bred."

"You'll never persuade me to believe that."

"Will you bet, then?"

"It's mer
ely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be
 obstinate."

The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said he.

The small boy brought round a small
 thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.

"Now then, Mr. Cocksu
re," said the salesman, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one l
eft in my shop. You see this little book?"

"Well?"

"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, t
hen, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the bi
g ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that
 third name. Just read it out to me."

"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.

"Quite so. Now turn tha
t up in the ledger."

Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and 
poultry supplier.' "

"Now, then, what's the last entry?"

" 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "

"Quite 
so. There you are. And underneath?"

" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.' "

"What have you to say now?"


Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning
 away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and lau
ghed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.

"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and t
he 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put 
$100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the id
ea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point w
hich remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve
 it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxio
us about the matter, and I should--"

His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the s
tall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of y
ellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall,
 was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.

"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish
 you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. 
You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?"

"No
; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man.

"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."

"She told 
me to ask you."

"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!" He 
rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.

"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton R
oad," whispered Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow." Striding through the scatt
ered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched 
him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven
 from his face.

"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.

"You will excuse me," said Ho
lmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I 
could be of assistance to you."

"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"

"My name is Sherlock
 Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know."

"But you can know nothing of this?"

"Excuse me, I
 know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, t
o a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. 
Henry Baker is a member."

"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with o
utstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."

Sherlock 
Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in 
this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure o
f assisting."

The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a sidelong glance.

"No
, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with an alias."

A flush sprang to th
e white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James Ryder."

"Precisely so. Head attendant a
t the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wis
h to know."

The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as on
e who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in 
half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, 
thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension wit
hin him.

"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very seasonable in this weat
her. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this littl
e matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or rather, I fancy, of tha
t goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail."

Ryder qu
ivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"

"It came here."

"Here?"

"Yes, and a 
most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was de
ad--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum."

Our visitor staggered 
to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue car
buncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn 
face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or you
'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
 impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"

For a 
moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat stari
ng with frightened eyes at his accuser.

"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could poss
ibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case c
omplete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?"

"It was Catherine Cusack who told me
 of it," said he in a crackling voice.

"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so
 easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in 
the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that th
is man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more rea
dily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--and
 you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm,
 and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--"

Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at m
y companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break the
ir hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it in
to court! For Christ's sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and
 crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."

"I 
will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down."

"Hum! We will tal
k about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the
 goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety."

Ryder passed his tongue ov
er his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been arrested, it seeme
d to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police
 might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be sa
fe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and
 lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be
 a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came 
to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been up
set by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be
 best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Penton
ville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they s
tole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on
 to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But 
how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any mom
ent be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at th
e time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which
 showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some weeks before that I migh
t have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would tak
e my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I d
rove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the
 stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gul
let and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matte
r. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.

" 'Whatever were you doing 
with that bird, Jem?' says she.

" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which
 was the fattest.'

" 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one 
over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.'

" '
Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'

" 
'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'

" 'Never mind. I'll hav
e the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.

" 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you wa
nt, then?'

" 'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'

" 'Oh, very well. Kill it and
 take it with you.'

"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my
 pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and
 we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that s
ome terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There
 was not a bird to be seen there.

" 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.

" 'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'

" 'Which
 dealer's?'

" 'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'

" 'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as
 the one I chose?'

" 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.'

"Well, then,
 of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold th
e lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, 
he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And no
w--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God hel
p me! God help me!" He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.

There was a long silence, b
roken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the ta
ble. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"

"No more 
words. Get out!"

And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and
 the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.

"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for h
is clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be ano
ther thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a 
felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frig
htened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance
 has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the g
oodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief featu
re."

VIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND


On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have 
during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large
 number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acqu
irement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and
 even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features t
han that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in questio
n occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. 
It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from 
which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It
 is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rum
ours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.

It was
 early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side 
of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-p
ast seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my
 habits.

"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been 
knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."

"What is it, then--a fire?"

"No; a client. It seems that a young l
ady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-
room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out 
of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an 
interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call
 you and give you the chance."

"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."

I had no keener pleasure than in
 following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, a
nd yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly
 threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed i
n black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.

"Good-morning, madam," said Holm
es cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can s
peak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray
 draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."

"It is not cold wh
ich makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, Mr.
 Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of
 agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her feature
s and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary
 and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.

"You must not fear," sa
id he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You hav
e come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket
 in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy
 roads, before you reached the station."

The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.


"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less
 than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that wa
y, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly
 correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first tr
ain to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--no
ne, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I ha
ve heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your ad
dress. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense dar
kness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six wee
ks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."

Holme
s turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.

"Farintosh," said he. "Ah ye
s, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, m
adam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my pr
ofession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which sui
ts you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the mat
ter."

"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and
 my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all
 others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervou
s woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holm
es, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the d
angers which encompass me."

"I am all attention, madam."

"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfath
er, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the west
ern border of Surrey."

Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.

"The family was at one time a
mong the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in 
the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the f
amily ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of gro
und, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out 
his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that
 he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medica
l degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a larg
e practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his
 native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment a
nd afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.

"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother
, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, an
d we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less th
an $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a c
ertain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England m
y mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attemp
ts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran.
 The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness
.

"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits w
ith our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he s
hut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his pa
th. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case
 it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place,
 two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly a
t his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

"Last week he hurle
d the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gathe
r together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and
 he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family 
estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on en
d. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment
 a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their
 master.

"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No ser
vant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her 
death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."

"Your sister is dead, then?"

"She died just
 two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I 
have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother'
s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits 
at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom
 she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the 
marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which h
as deprived me of my only companion."

Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and hi
s head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.

"Pray be precise as to 
details," said he.

"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The 
manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are o
n the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr.
 Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open o
ut into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"

"Perfectly so."

"The windows of the three rooms open out upon t
he lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for
 my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room,
 therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o'cloc
k she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.

" 'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever hea
rd anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'

" 'Never,' said I.

" 'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, y
ourself, in your sleep?'

" 'Certainly not. But why?'

" 'Because during the last few nights I have always, about thr
ee in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it c
ame from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had hear
d it.'

" 'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'

" 'Very likely. And yet if it were 
on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'

" 'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'

" 'Well, it is of 
no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key tu
rn in the lock."

"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"

"Always."

"And
 why?"

"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security u
nless our doors were locked."

"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."

"I could not sleep that night. A vague 
feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtl
e are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, 
and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst fo
rth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl
 round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister descri
bed, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister
's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about
 to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with te
rror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw
 my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one wh
o is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, bu
t as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the 
band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger in
to the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed ou
t, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my s
ister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the villa
ge, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the d
readful end of my beloved sister."

"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? C
ould you swear to it?"

"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I 
heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."


"Was your sister dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a matc
h, and in her left a match-box."

"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place
. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"

"He investigated the case with great care, for D
r. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death
. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashion
ed shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to
 be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, 
but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end
. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."

"How about poison?"

"The doctors examined her for it, but
 without success."

"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"

"It is my belief that she died of 
pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."

"Were there gipsies in the pl
antation at the time?"

"Yes, there are nearly always some there."

"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion t
o a band--a speckled band?"

"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that i
t may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether th
e spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which 
she used."

Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.

"These are very deep waters," said he;
 "pray go on with your narrative."

"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier tha
n ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand 
in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My s
tepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago 
some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had 
to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my 
thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of
 the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was 
to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I 
slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come o
n this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."

"You have done wisely," said my friend. "B
ut have you told me all?"

"Yes, all."

"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."

"Why, what 
do you mean?"

For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor
's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.

"You hav
e been cruelly used," said Holmes.

The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," 
she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."

There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his c
hin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.

"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a
 thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment t
o lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the kno
wledge of your stepfather?"

"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. I
t is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now
, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."

"Excellent. You are not averse to this tri
p, Watson?"

"By no means."

"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"

"I have one or two things
 which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in
 time for your coming."

"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to 
attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"

"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my 
trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her f
ace and glided from the room.

"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his 
chair.

"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."

"Dark enough and sinister enough."

"Yet if the la
dy is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,
 then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."

"What becomes, then, of these no
cturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"

"I cannot think."

"When you combine the 
ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fac
t that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the
 dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have bee
n caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good
 ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."

"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"

"I canno
t imagine."

"I see many objections to any such theory."

"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are g
oing to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But w
hat in the name of the devil!"

The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been s
uddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of th
e professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a
 hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and hi
s breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow wi
th the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot
 eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.

"Which of
 you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.

"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly.


"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."

"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."

"I will d
o nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"

"It is a 
little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.

"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiousl
y.

"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.

"Ha! You put me off, do
 you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel! I have h
eard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."

My friend smiled.

"Holmes, the busybody!"

His smile broadened.


"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"

Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most entertaining," said
 he. "When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."

"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you
 dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall fo
ul of! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.


"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode o
ut of the room.

"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had rem
ained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he picked up the steel 
poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.

"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the 
official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little fr
iend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfa
st, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this mat
ter."

It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blu
e paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.

"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To determine i
ts exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. Th
e total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100, is now, through the fall in agricult
ural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage. It is evident, there
fore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would crippl
e him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very stron
gest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, espe
cially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a
 cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's
 No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I t
hink, all that we need."

At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at
 the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a brigh
t sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green s
hoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast bet
ween the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the fron
t of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the d
eepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.

"Look there!
" said he.

A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. Fro
m amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.

"Stoke Moran?" said h
e.

"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.

"There is some building going on the
re," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."

"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roo
fs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, an
d so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."

"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Ston
er," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."

We got off, paid our fare, a
nd the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.

"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "th
at this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Goo
d-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."

Our client of the morning had hurried forw
ard to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands wi
th us warmly. "All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back b
efore evening."

"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he s
ketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he 
has followed me, then."

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he 
say when he returns?"

"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon h
is track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Har
row. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."

Th
e building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a
 crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while t
he roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand b
lock was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showe
d that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work 
had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and 
down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.

"This, I take it, belongs to
 the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr. R
oylott's chamber?"

"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."

"Pending the alterations, as I understand
. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."

"There were none. I be
lieve that it was an excuse to move me from my room."

"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow
 wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"

"Yes, but very small
 ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."

"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachab
le from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"

Miss Stoner did so,
 and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open,
 but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he
 tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching hi
s chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they 
were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."

A small side door led into the whit
ewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at o
nce to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was 
a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown che
st of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand 
side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for
 a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten o
ak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the cha
irs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of
 the apartment.

"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung d
own beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.

"It goes to the housekeeper's room."

"It looks newer
 than the other things?"

"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."

"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"


"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."

"Indeed, it seemed unnece
ssary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.
" He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining m
inutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. F
inally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Fi
nally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's a dummy," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"N
o, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just ab
ove where the little opening for the ventilator is."

"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."

"Very strange!
" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what
 a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communic
ated with the outside air!"

"That is also quite modern," said the lady.

"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?
" remarked Holmes.

"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."

"They seem to have been of
 a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss S
toner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."

Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than t
hat of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a t
echnical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iro
n safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with
 the keenest interest.

"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.

"My stepfather's business papers."

"Oh! you h
ave seen inside, then?"

"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."

"There isn't a cat in i
t, for example?"

"No. What a strange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on 
the top of it.

"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."

"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah
 is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one po
int which I should wish to determine." He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with
 the greatest attention.

"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. "Hu
llo! Here is something interesting!"

The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of 
the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.

"What do you make of t
hat, Watson?"

"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied."

"That is not quite so common, is
 it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think tha
t I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."

I had never seen m
y friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had wal
ked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
 roused himself from his reverie.

"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow m
y advice in every respect."

"I shall most certainly do so."

"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your lif
e may depend upon your compliance."

"I assure you that I am in your hands."

"In the first place, both my friend and
 I must spend the night in your room."

Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.

"Yes, it must be so. Le
t me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?"

"Yes, that is the Crown."

"Very good. Your window
s would be visible from there?"

"Certainly."

"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, wh
en your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window
, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likel
y to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage the
re for one night."

"Oh, yes, easily."

"The rest you will leave in our hands."

"But what will you do?"

"We shall s
pend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."

"I believe, 
Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.


"Perhaps I have."

"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."

"I should prefer to hav
e clearer proofs before I speak."

"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from 
some sudden fright."

"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss
 Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brav
e, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threa
ten you."

Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were
 on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Sto
ke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figu
re of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoa
rse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and
 a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.


"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to
 taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."

"Can I be of assistance?"

"Your presence might be inv
aluable."

"Then I shall certainly come."

"It is very kind of you."

"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen m
ore in these rooms than was visible to me."

"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that y
ou saw all that I did."

"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess i
s more than I can imagine."

"You saw the ventilator, too?"

"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual 
thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."

"I knew that
 we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."

"My dear Holmes!"

"Oh, yes, I did. You remember i
n her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that 
there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upo
n at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."

"But what harm can there be in that?"

"Well, there is at least
 a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does no
t that strike you?"

"I cannot as yet see any connection."

"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"


"No."

"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"

"I cannot say that I have."


"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope
--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."

"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly w
hat you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."

"Subtle enough and horr
ible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and 
Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall 
be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us 
have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."

About nine o'clock the light among
 the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and 
then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.

"That is our sig
nal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."

As we passed out he exchanged a few wor
ds with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that
 we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and 
one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.

There was little diffi
culty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we
 reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes ther
e darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and the
n ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.

"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"

Holmes was for the moment
 as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put
 his lips to my ear.

"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."

I had forgotten the strange pets 
which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I con
fess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself in
side the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes roun
d the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whi
spered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:

"The least sound would 
be fatal to our plans."

I nodded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit without light. He would see it through the 
ventilator."

I nodded again.

"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case w
e should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."

I took out my revolver and laid it on t
he corner of the table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he
 laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.

How 
shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew t
hat my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. 
The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

From outside came the occasional cr
y of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed 
at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How
 long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for wh
atever might befall.

Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which 
vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room h
ad lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew s
tronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, sooth
ing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes
 sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.

"You see it, Watson?" he 
yelled. "You see it?"

But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, bu
t the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashe
d so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased
 to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horri
ble cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all 
mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that c
ry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, unt
il the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.

"What can it mean?" I gasped.

"It means
 that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will en
ter Dr. Roylott's room."

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the
 chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked p
istol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter hal
f open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the 
wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his
 feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had n
oticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of
 the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly 
round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.

I 
took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair th
e squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadli
est snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent,
 and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we 
can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."

As he spoke 
he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
 its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.

Such are t
he true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narra
tive which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we c
onveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry 
came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which
 I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.

"I had," said he, "com
e to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insuffic
ient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to
 explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put m
e upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, i
t became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or
 the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-ro
pe which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instan
tly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming 
to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
 furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a 
form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a cl
ever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would 
also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the tw
o little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. O
f course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by 
the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour
 that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might no
t bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.

"I
 had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had b
een in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. 
The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which ma
y have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the d
oor of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to 
put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the 
light and attacked it."

"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."

"And also with the result of causin
g it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper,
 so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Royl
ott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."

IX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE
 ENGINEER'S THUMB


Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution dur
ing the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice--that of Mr. Ha
therley's thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an 
acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may
 be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods
 of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the
 newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-
column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each
 new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impre
ssion upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.

It was in the summer of '89, not l
ong after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice a
nd had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even p
ersuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as 
I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. 
One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of e
ndeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.

One morning, at a little before seve
n o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were 
waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial,
 and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly be
hind him.

"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."

"What is it, th
en?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.

"It's a n
ew patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe a
nd sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without
 even giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was qu
ietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his
 hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-a
nd-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a m
an who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.

"I am sorry to k
nock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train 
this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted 
me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table."

I took it up and glanced at it
. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name, style, and abode o
f my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fre
sh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my night could not be calle
d monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair a
nd shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself togeth
er!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outb
ursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more
, very weary and pale-looking.

"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.

"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed
 some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

"That's better!" said he. "A
nd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be."

He u
nwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were fo
ur protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn r
ight out from the roots.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably."

"Yes
, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I f
ound that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up w
ith a twig."

"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."

"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within
 my own province."

"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument."

"A th
ing like a cleaver," said he.

"An accident, I presume?"

"By no means."

"What! a murderous attack?"

"Very murderou
s indeed."

"You horrify me."

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton w
adding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

"How is that?"
 I asked when I had finished.

"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but
 I have had a good deal to go through."

"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to y
our nerves."

"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not fo
r the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a ver
y extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, 
the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if
 it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to
 my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police."

"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered 
my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official polic
e as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."

"I shoul
d be immensely obliged to you."

"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfa
st with him. Do you feel equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."

"Then my servant wi
ll call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, an
d in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.

Sherlock Holmes was, as I e
xpected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his 
before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all ca
refully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered f
resh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
 sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.

"It is easy to see t
hat your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolute
ly at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."

"T
hank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfas
t has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon 
my peculiar experiences."

Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his ke
en and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor d
etailed to us.

"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. 
By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years tha
t I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, an
d having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for mys
elf and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.

"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
 business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations an
d one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Ev
ery day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart bega
n to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.

"Yesterday, however, just as I was th
inking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon busines
s. He brought up a card, too, with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the
 colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever se
en so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense 
over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye wa
s bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, wo
uld be nearer forty than thirty.

" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent. 'You have been recom
mended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and cap
able of preserving a secret.'

"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. 'May I ask w
ho it was who gave me so good a character?'

" 'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at th
is moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London
.'

" 'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon
 my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?'


" 'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you,
 but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more fro
m a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'

" 'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I,
 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'

"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had
 never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

" 'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.

" 'Yes, I promise.'

"
 'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writi
ng?'

" 'I have already given you my word.'

" 'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across 
the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.

" 'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know 
that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very
 close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

"A feeling of repulsion
, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my drea
d of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.

" 'I beg that you will state your business, s
ir,' said I; 'my time is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.

" 'How 
would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.

" 'Most admirably.'

" 'I say a night's work, but an hou
r's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear
. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?'


" 'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'

" 'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by th
e last train.'

" 'Where to?'

" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and 
within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'

" 'Very
 good.'

" 'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'

" 'There is a drive, then?'

" 'Yes, our little place is q
uite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'

" 'Then we can hardly get there before midni
ght. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.'

" 'Yes, we could 
easily give you a shake-down.'

" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?'

" 'We have 
judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a 
young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if 
you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'

"I thought of the fifty guineas, and 
of how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wi
shes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'

" 'Quite so. I
t is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I hav
e no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe
 from eavesdroppers?'

" 'Entirely.'

" 'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a
 valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?'

" 'I have heard so.'

" 'Some little 
time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover 
that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit w
as a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--bo
th of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land cont
ained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they
 discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends i
nto the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that 
in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doin
g for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have alread
y explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, howe
ver, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inqu
iry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our
 plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-n
ight. I hope that I make it all plain?'

" 'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not quite unde
rstand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug 
out like gravel from a pit.'

" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks
, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my con
fidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at
 Eyford at 11:15.'

" 'I shall certainly be there.'

" 'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, 
questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.

"Well, when I came to 
think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which ha
d been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have a
sked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the oth
er hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his e
xplanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme a
nxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to
 Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.

"At Reading I had 
to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the
 little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon t
he platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my 
acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried m
e into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-wor
k, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."

"One horse?" interjected Holmes.

"Yes, only one."

"Did you obs
erve the colour?"

"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut."

"Tir
ed-looking or fresh?"

"Oh, fresh and glossy."

"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your mo
st interesting statement."

"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said th
at it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, t
hat it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when 
I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very goo
d in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something 
of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur o
f a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered
 only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged fo
r the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, a
s I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out 
of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The 
instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wh
eels as the carriage drove away.

"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matc
hes and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of
 light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above
 her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which
 the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in
 a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start tha
t the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing
 her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.

" 'Perhaps y
ou will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quie
t, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Co
lonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' 
said he, and vanished into the darkness.

"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of Ger
man I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across 
to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was fo
lded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, bu
t otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German 
people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten mil
es or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Re
ading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet
 it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, hummin
g a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.

"Sudde
nly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The wo
man was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her
 eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own 
heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English a
t me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.

" 'I would go,' said she,
 trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to d
o.'

" 'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the mach
ine.'

" 'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.' And then
, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her h
ands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'

"But I am 
somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I th
ought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was 
it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment w
hich was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manne
r had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I wa
s. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard u
pon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly a
nd as noiselessly as she had come.

"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchill
a beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.

" 'This is my secre
tary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I f
ear that you have felt the draught.'

" 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I felt the room 
to be a little close.'

"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,
' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.'

" 'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'

" '
Oh, no, it is in the house.'

" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'

" 'No, no. This is only where we compre
ss it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.
'

"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth 
of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which w
ere hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above t
he ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy b
lotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even 
though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent 
man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.

"Colonel Lysander Stark 
stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could
 hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.

" 'We are now,' said he, 'actuall
y within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. Th
e ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many 
tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which trans
mit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffn
ess in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over a
nd to show us how we can set it right.'

"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It wa
s indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed dow
n the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed
 a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands
 which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This 
was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very caref
ully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to
 them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was o
bvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose
 that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor cons
isted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I ha
d stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw t
he cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.

" 'What are you doing there?' he asked.

"I felt angry at havi
ng been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; '
I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which 
it was used.'

"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a 
baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.

" 'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He took a 
step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle,
 but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! L
et me out!'

"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of
 the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor
 where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, 
slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeles
s pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to
 let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my
 head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain 
of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upo
n my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve t
o lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye
 caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.

"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were
 of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between t
wo of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly b
elieve that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-f
ainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments after
wards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.

"I was recalled to myself by a fra
ntic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent ove
r me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose war
ning I had so foolishly rejected.

" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will 
see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'

"This time, at least, I did not scorn 
her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to an
other broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one
 answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her 
like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which th
e moon was shining brightly.

" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'


"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysa
nder Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed ac
ross the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the m
oonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump unti
l I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at an
y risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was a
t the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.

" 'Fritz! Fritz!'
 she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent
! Oh, he will be silent!'

" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'You will be the ru
in of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me
 with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was cons
cious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.

"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so
 I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from bein
g out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my 
hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the bl
ood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my e
ars, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.

"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. I
t must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My
 clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of 
it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that 
I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor 
garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down
 was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the pr
evious night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have
 been an evil dream.

"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to R
eading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of hi
m whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the ni
ght before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles 
off.

"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telli
ng my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and the
n the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you adv
ise."

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Hol
mes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.

"Here is an a
dvertisement which will interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Los
t, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at
 night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colon
el needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."

"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the g
irl said."

"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determi
ned that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivo
r from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Y
ard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."

Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train tog
ether, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspec
tor Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the count
y out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.

"There you are," sa
id he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that
 line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."

"It was an hour's good drive."

"And you think that they brought you back 
all that way when you were unconscious?"

"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lift
ed and conveyed somewhere."

"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have spared you when they found 
you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."

"I hardly think that 
likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."

"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Wel
l, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be f
ound."

"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.

"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have fo
rmed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted t
here."

"And I say east," said my patient.

"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are several quiet
 little villages up there."

"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, and our friend says tha
t he did not notice the carriage go up any."

"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of
 opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"

"You are all wrong."

"But we c
an't all be."

"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. "This is where
 we shall find them."

"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.

"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You sa
y yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over
 heavy roads?"

"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no do
ubt as to the nature of this gang."

"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, and have used th
e machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."

"We have known for some time that a clever gang 
was at work," said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far
 as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old
 hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."

But the inspector was mis
taken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we s
aw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like
 an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.

"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again o
n its way.

"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.

"When did it break out?"

"I hear that it was during the night, sir
, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becher's."

"Tell me," broke 
in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"

The station-master laughed heartily. 
"No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he h
as a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Ber
kshire beef would do him no harm."

The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in th
e direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front o
f us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving t
o keep the flames under.

"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there 
are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."

"Well, at least," said Holmes, "
you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in
 the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it 
at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they 
are a good hundred miles off by now."

And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has e
ver been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a pea
sant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, 
but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue 
as to their whereabouts.

The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within
, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, 
however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, a
nd the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace 
remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin we
re discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those b
ulky boxes which have been already referred to.

How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the 
spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told u
s a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the
 other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less m
urderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.

"Well," sa
id our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I
 have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?"

"Experience," said Holmes, laughing
. "Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excell
ent company for the remainder of your existence."

X.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR


The Lord St. Simon marri
age, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the 
unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips 
away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been reveale
d to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel 
that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.

It was a few weeks be
fore my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home f
rom an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weathe
r had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of
 my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs
 upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, 
I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and w
ondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.

"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he
 entered. "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter."

"Yes, my correspon
dence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more interesting. T
his looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."

He broke
 the seal and glanced over the contents.

"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."

"Not soci
al, then?"

"No, distinctly professional."

"And from a noble client?"

"One of the highest in England."

"My dear fe
llow, I congratulate you."

"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of l
ess moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in th
is new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"

"It looks like it," said I
 ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."

"It is fortunate, for you will 
perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always ins
tructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"


"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."

"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I 
will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. Th
is is what he says:

" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon
 your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the 
very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting alread
y in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it mi
ght be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at
 that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,


" 'ST. S
IMON.'

"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to 
get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.

"He
 says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."

"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to g
et clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a gla
nce as to who our client is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece
. "Here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. " 'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simo
n, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' 
He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administrat
ion. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct de
scent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must tu
rn to you Watson, for something more solid."

"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I, "for th
e facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew t
hat you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."

"Oh, you mean the little probl
em of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first
. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."

"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the p
ersonal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 
'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Ba
lmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all.
"

"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.

"There was a paragrap
h amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for prote
ction in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. 
One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from acr
oss the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been 
borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the 
little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating dau
ghter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at th
e Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably 
over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been co
mpelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the sma
ll estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will e
nable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' "

"Anything else?" as
ked Holmes, yawning.

"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would
 be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friend
s would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by 
Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had tak
en place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notic
es which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."

"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.

"The vanish
ing of the lady."

"When did she vanish, then?"

"At the wedding breakfast."

"Indeed. This is more interesting than 
it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."

"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."

"They often v
anish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt 
as this. Pray let me have the details."

"I warn you that they are very incomplete."

"Perhaps we may make them less 
so."

"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to
 you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':

" 'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been 
thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with 
his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it 
is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. 
In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that
 no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.

" 'The ceremony,
 which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of t
he bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the you
nger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the 
house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little troubl
e was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after t
he bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scen
e that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this un
pleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and ret
ired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her mai
d that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the pa
ssage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit
 that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, M
r. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and
 very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular bu
siness. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. Ther
e are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had 
caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned 
in the strange disappearance of the bride.' "

"And is that all?"

"Only one little item in another of the morning pa
pers, but it is a suggestive one."

"And it is--"

"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, 
has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the br
idegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has 
been set forth in the public press."

"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed 
it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no
 doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a wi
tness, if only as a check to my own memory."

"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open the door
. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
 the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be ob
eyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forwa
rd stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was 
grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with hig
h collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He adva
nced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held hi
s golden eyeglasses.

"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray take the basket-chair. This i
s my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over."

"A most pai
nful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you h
ave already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same cl
ass of society."

"No, I am descending."

"I beg pardon."

"My last client of the sort was a king."

"Oh, really! I h
ad no idea. And which king?"

"The King of Scandinavia."

"What! Had he lost his wife?"

"You can understand," said H
olmes suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours."


"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information 
which may assist you in forming an opinion."

"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, no
thing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.
"

Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."

"But it needs a great deal of supplement
ing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."

"
Pray do so."

"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"

"In San Francisco, a year ago."

"You were travelling in t
he States?"

"Yes."

"Did you become engaged then?"

"No."

"But you were on a friendly footing?"

"I was amused by h
er society, and she could see that I was amused."

"Her father is very rich?"

"He is said to be the richest man on t
he Pacific slope."

"And how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold
, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."

"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife
's character?"

The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," 
said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and 
wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. Sh
e is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She
 is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her reso
lutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little st
ately cough--"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacri
fice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."

"Have you her photograph?"

"I brought this with me
." He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniat
ure, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisit
e mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.

"The
 young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"

"Yes, her father brought her over for this las
t London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her."

"She brought, I understa
nd, a considerable dowry?"

"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."

"And this, of course, remains to yo
u, since the marriage is a fait accompli?"

"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."

"Very naturally not. D
id you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?"

"Yes."

"Was she in good spirits?"

"Never better. She kept ta
lking of what we should do in our future lives."

"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the weddin
g?"

"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."

"And did you observe any change in her then
?"

"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp
. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case."

"Pray let us have
 it, for all that."

"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the 
front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed
 it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she a
nswered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"
Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?"

"Oh, yes. It 
is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."

"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"

"No, n
o; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
 really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."

"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding i
n a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?"

"I saw 
her in conversation with her maid."

"And who is her maid?"

"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from Cal
ifornia with her."

"A confidential servant?"

"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her t
o take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way."

"How long did 
she speak to this Alice?"

"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."

"You did not overhear what they sa
id?"

"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no 
idea what she meant."

"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished spea
king to her maid?"

"She walked into the breakfast-room."

"On your arm?"

"No, alone. She was very independent in li
ttle matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of
 apology, and left the room. She never came back."

"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to 
her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."

"Quite so. And she was after
wards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already ma
de a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning."

"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady
, and your relations to her."

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a frie
ndly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated 
her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora w
as a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when s
he heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quie
tly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returne
d, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening he
r, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes
, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."

"Did your wife 
hear all this?"

"No, thank goodness, she did not."

"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"

"Ye
s. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife ou
t and laid some terrible trap for her."

"Well, it is a possible supposition."

"You think so, too?"

"I did not say 
a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"

"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."

"Still,
 jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"

"Well, really
, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say 
that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so imm
ense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."

"In short, that she had
 become suddenly deranged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but
 upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."

"Well, certa
inly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have near
ly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"

"
We could see the other side of the road and the Park."

"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you long
er. I shall communicate with you."

"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.


"I have solved it."

"Eh? What was that?"

"I say that I have solved it."

"Where, then, is my wife?"

"That is a de
tail which I shall speedily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than 
yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"It is very good of Lord St.
 Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shal
l have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case bef
ore our client came into the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I rem
arked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circums
tantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."


"But I have heard all that you have heard."

"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me 
so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Muni
ch the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Le
strade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."

The official detective 
was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas
 bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.

"What's u
p, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."

"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infe
rnal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."

"Really! You surprise me."

"Who ev
er heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."


"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

"Yes, I have b
een dragging the Serpentine."

"In heaven's name, what for?"

"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."

Sherlock Ho
lmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he as
ked.

"Why? What do you mean?"

"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the oth
er."

Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snarled.

"Well, I have on
ly just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."

"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in t
he matter?"

"I think it very unlikely."

"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" 
He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoe
s and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring up
on the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowi
ng blue rings into the air. "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"

"No. They were found floating near the margin by
 a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body
 would not be far off."

"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of hi
s wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the
 disappearance."

"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bi
tterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have ma
de two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."

"And how?"

"In the dress is a poc
ket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down upon th
e table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory a
ll along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, wa
s responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slip
ped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."

"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing.
 "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantl
y became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.

"Ha! you find it so
?"

"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."

Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shr
ieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"

"On the contrary, this is the right side."

"The right side? You're mad! 
Here is the note written in pencil over here."

"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, wh
ich interests me deeply."

"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. " 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., bre
akfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."

"Very likely not. It is most
 important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you a
gain."

"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spin
ning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first." He gathered
 up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.

"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes 
before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, 
and there never has been, any such person."

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his 
forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes 
rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I thin
k, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."

It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left m
e, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. 
This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment,
 a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a coupl
e of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having
 laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanatio
n save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.

Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes 
stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think th
at he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.

"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.


"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he.
 "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."


It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and
 with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

"
Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?"

"The bes
t possible."

Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.

"What will the Duke say," he m
urmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

"It is the purest accident. 
I cannot allow that there is any humiliation."

"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."

"I fail to s
ee that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doi
ng it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis."

"It was a s
light, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.

"You must make allowance for 
this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."

"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I hav
e been shamefully used."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cann
ot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more
 successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduc
e you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met."

At the sight of these newcomers
 our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breas
t of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand
 to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face wa
s one which it was hard to resist.

"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every cause to be."

"P
ray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that
 I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again 
I just didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the
 altar."

"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?"


"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this busin
ess already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunbu
rnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.

"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Fr
ank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each
 other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim 
that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear of our eng
agement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed 
me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fix
ed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until
 he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone e
lse while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I
 won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, wi
th a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, an
d I went back to Pa.

"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona,
 and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been at
tacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick fo
r months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a 
year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came t
o London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth wou
ld ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of
 course I'd have done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him
 with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just
 as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I though
t it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if t
o ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, a
nd the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the
 service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he ra
ised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he w
as writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note in
to my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to d
o so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever 
he might direct.

"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I
 ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lor
d St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run awa
y and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other si
de of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed
 him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as 
if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank
. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true 
wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisc
o, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on
 the very morning of my second wedding."

"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name and the ch
urch but not where the lady lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but
 I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just send
ing a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies si
tting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and mad
e a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It 
is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us
 this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was w
rong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he off
ered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. No
w, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
 meanly of me."

Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and
 a compressed lip to this long narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate
 personal affairs in this public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"

"Oh, cert
ainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

"I
 had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."

"I think that there you ask a l
ittle too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly
 be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night." H
e included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.

"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with
 your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who
 believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children
 from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Ja
ck with the Stars and Stripes."

"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left u
s, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems 
to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and no
thing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard."

"You were not yourself 
at fault at all, then?"

"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite wil
ling to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. O
bviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something 
be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she 
seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country
 that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would 
induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea
 that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence o
ver her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and 
under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man i
n a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bo
uquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners
' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became abso
lutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances bein
g in favour of the latter."

"And how in the world did you find them?"

"It might have been difficult, but friend Les
trade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the 
highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the m
ost select London hotels."

"How did you deduce the select?"

"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and ei
ghtpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge
 at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book tha
t Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against hi
m, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon 
Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
 some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their posit
ion a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here,
 and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."

"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was cer
tainly not very gracious."

"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, a
fter all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think
 that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in t
he same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to whi
le away these bleak autumnal evenings."

XI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET


"Holmes," said I as I stood one mo
rning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relativ
es should allow him to come out alone."

My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pock
ets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day 
before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had 
been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-pat
hs it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously s
lippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no on
e was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was a man of about fifty, 
tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre 
yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actio
ns were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little 
springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his han
ds up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.

"What on earth can b
e the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the houses."

"I believe that he is coming here,
" said Holmes, rubbing his hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think t
hat I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door 
and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.

A few moments later he was in our room, st
ill puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turn
ed in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at h
is hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he be
at his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room
. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him i
n the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

"You have come to me to tell your story, have you no
t?" said he. "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most
 happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me."

The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving 
chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned hi
s face towards us.

"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Ho
lmes.

"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public dis
grace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is
 the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very sou
l. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible 
affair."

"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is t
hat has befallen you."

"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, o
f the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."

The name was indeed well known to us as belonging
 to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened,
 then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until wi
th another effort he braced himself to tell his story.

"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I haste
ned here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Un
derground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breat
h, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly a
nd yet as clearly as I can.

"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depen
ds upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the n
umber of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the secu
rity is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble
 families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.

"Yesterday m
orning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I 
saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was
 a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I w
as overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the
 air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

" 'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informe
d that you are in the habit of advancing money.'

" 'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.

" 'It 
is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have $50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling 
a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that busines
s myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'

" 'For
 how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

" 'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then 
most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential 
to me that the money should be paid at once.'

" 'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own 
private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, 
I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every bus
inesslike precaution should be taken.'

" 'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a square, black m
orocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'

" 'One of the most 
precious public possessions of the empire,' said I.

" 'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, 
flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous ber
yls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the cor
onet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'

"I took the precious 
case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

" 'You doubt its value?' he asked
.

" 'Not at all. I only doubt--'

" 'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I sho
uld not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pu
re matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'

" 'Ample.'

" 'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a st
rong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only
 to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every po
ssible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. A
ny injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these,
 and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call fo
r it in person on Monday morning.'

"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my c
ashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lyin
g upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it en
tailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any 
misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too la
te to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.

"When evening came
 I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had been 
forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find mysel
f! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so
 that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Stre
atham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau
 of my dressing-room.

"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the si
tuation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who
 have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the
 second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and ha
s always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about
 the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in 
every way.

"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I a
m a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. 
I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear w
ife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face
. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it
 for the best.

"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business
 turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. W
hen he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the inti
mate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander mo
ney on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance,
 that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he 
was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.

"And
, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has fre
quently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He
 is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brillia
nt talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of hi
s presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who sh
ould be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into chara
cter.

"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left 
her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my hous
e--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could
 be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my
 wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I th
ink that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have 
changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who l
ive under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.

"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room tha
t night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof,
 suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but
 I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, 
but I thought it better not to disturb it.

" 'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.

" 'In my own bureau.'

" 'Well,
 I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.

" 'It is locked up,' I answered.

" 'Oh, 
any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboar
d.'

"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, howeve
r, that night with a very grave face.

" 'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let me have $200
?'

" 'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.'

" 'You have been
 very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'

" 'And a
 very good thing, too!' I cried.

" 'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'I could no
t bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other me
ans.'

"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I 
cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.

"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure t
hat my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a dut
y which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I
 saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.

" 'Tell me, dad,' s
aid she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'

" 'Certain
ly not.'

" 'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see so
meone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'

" 'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will
 if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'

" 'Quite sure, dad.'

" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed h
er and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.

"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, 
which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clea
r."

"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."

"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish
 to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even l
ess so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was
 wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening 
with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I s
lipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.

" 'Arthur!' I sc
reamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'

"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my un
happy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. H
e appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and tur
ned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was 
missing.

" 'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me for
ever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'

" 'Stolen!' he cried.

" 'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by t
he shoulder.

" 'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.

" 'There are three missing. And you 
know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'


" 'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about th
is business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the wo
rld.'

" 'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this ma
tter probed to the bottom.'

" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as I should not have th
ought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'

"By this time the wh
ole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sigh
t of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground
. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a c
onstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention
 to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since t
he ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.

" 'At leas
t,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave t
he house for five minutes.'

" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I.
 And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour 
but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convul
se the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.

" 'You 
may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more 
heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiv
en and forgotten.'

" 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a snee
r. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in t
he inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every
 portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would
 the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and 
I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unra
velling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any e
xpense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of $1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my h
onour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked h
imself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for 
some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.


"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several tim
es lately. No one else, I think."

"Do you go out much in society?"

"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neithe
r of us care for it."

"That is unusual in a young girl."

"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very you
ng. She is four-and-twenty."

"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also."

"Terrible! S
he is even more affected than I."

"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"

"How can we have when
 I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."

"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the rema
inder of the coronet at all injured?"

"Yes, it was twisted."

"Do you not think, then, that he might have been tryin
g to straighten it?"

"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What
 was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"

"Precisely. And if it were guilty,
 why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the
 case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"

"They considered that it might be ca
used by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."

"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to
 wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"

"They are still sounding the planki
ng and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them."

"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"

"Yes, 
they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined."

"Now, my dear sir," said
 Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police
 were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Conside
r what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dre
ssing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to som
e other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then retur
ned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I
 ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "If 
his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"

"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now
, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more clo
sely into details."

My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do
, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt o
f the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Hol
mes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted e
xplanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast an
d his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the litt
le glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business
 affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financ
ier.

Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-
sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right
 side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to th
e kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not it
self within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door
 and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behin
d into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until h
e should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above
 the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I
 do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her ey
es were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than 
the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong charac
ter, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed he
r hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.

"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you n
ot, dad?" she asked.

"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."

"But I am so sure that he is innoc
ent. You know what woman's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted
 so harshly."

"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you sho
uld suspect him."

"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"

"Oh, but
 he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and 
say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"

"I shall never let it drop until the gems are
 found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the th
ing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."

"This gentleman?" she asked, fa
cing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now."

"The stabl
e lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, tha
t you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."

"I f
ully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knoc
k the snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or
 two?"

"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."

"You heard nothing yourself last night?"

"
Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down."

"You shut up the windows and doo
rs the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?"

"Yes."

"Were they all fastened this morning?"

"Yes."

"You h
ave a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?
"

"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the corone
t."

"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbe
ry."

"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I 
saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"

"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, M
iss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?"

"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened fo
r the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"Do you know him?"

"Oh, yes! he is the green-
grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."

"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the d
oor--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"

"Yes, he did."

"And he is a man with
 a wooden leg?"

Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why, you are like a magici
an," said she. "How do you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin, eager face.

"I 
should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. P
erhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."

He walked swiftly round from one to the other,
 pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very carefu
l examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.

The banker
's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holme
s went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.

"That which my s
on himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."

"Have you it here?"

"That is it on the dressing-tab
le."

Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it 
did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it." He opened the case, and tak
ing out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six
 stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding 
three gems had been torn away.

"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which h
as been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."

The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not
 dream of trying," said he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it
 give a little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to brea
k it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would
 be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you hea
rd nothing of it?"

"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."

"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. 
What do you think, Miss Holder?"

"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."

"Your son had no shoes or sl
ippers on when you saw him?"

"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."

"Thank you. We have certainly be
en favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed i
n clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."

He went
 alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For a
n hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as eve
r.

"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning 
to my rooms."

"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"

"I cannot tell."

The banker wrung his hands. "I shall ne
ver see them again!" he cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"

"My opinion is in no way altered."

"Then, for God's
 sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"

"If you can call upon me at my Baker Str
eet rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand t
hat you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on 
the sum I may draw."

"I would give my fortune to have them back."

"Very good. I shall look into the matter between 
this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening."

It was obvious
 to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I co
uld even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he a
lways glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ou
rselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loa
fer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of
 the class.

"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "I only wish that y
ou could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be followi
ng a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours." He cut a slice o
f beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal int
o his pocket he started off upon his expedition.

I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent
 spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cu
p of tea.

"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."

"Where to?"

"Oh, to the other side of th
e West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be late."

"How are you gett
ing on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call a
t the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not s
it gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self."

I could se
e by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, an
d there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the 
slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but
 there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and n
ights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he 
came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper
 in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.

"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but you 
remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."

"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I 
should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."

It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was 
shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now
 pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy
 which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which 
I pushed forward for him.

"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I wa
s a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow 
comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."

"Deserted you?"

"Yes. Her bed this morning
 had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, 
in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtl
ess of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:

" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have bro
ught trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cann
ot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do n
ot worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless la
bour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving


" 'MARY.'

"What could she mean by that n
ote, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"

"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible s
olution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."

"Ha! You say so! You have heard someth
ing, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?"

"You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum
 for them?"

"I would pay ten."

"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a lit
tle reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000."

With a dazed face the b
anker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with th
ree gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

"You have it!" he
 gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"

The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his re
covered gems to his bosom.

"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.

"Ow
e!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."

"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology
 to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, shoul
d I ever chance to have one."

"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"

"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, t
hat it was not."

"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known."

"H
e knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me t
he story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were no
t yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips."

"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, 
what is this extraordinary mystery!"

"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me 
say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding betwee
n Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."

"My Mary? Impossible!"

"It is unfortunatel
y more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted h
im into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate
 villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, a
s he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows be
st what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening."

"I canno
t, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your h
ouse last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover th
rough the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he s
tood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I
 have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and 
I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, 
on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,
 which was all perfectly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on acc
ount of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he ro
se and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared 
into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to
 see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passa
ge-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrillin
g with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall b
eneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once
 more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

"As long as she was on t
he scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that sh
e was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right.
 He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane
, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, an
d there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In t
he scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, findi
ng that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed
 that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the s
cene."

"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.

"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he fel
t that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who 
certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved
 her secret."

"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! w
hat a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see 
if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"

"When I arrived at the ho
use," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which
 might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to 
preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just
 beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impres
sions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had 
run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little
, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had alrea
dy spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tra
cks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in 
the snow in front of me.

"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw wi
th delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was y
our son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over th
e depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to
 the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a h
undred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had 
been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had t
hen run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to th
e highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.

"On enter
ing the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I co
uld at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been
 placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited ou
tside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had
 struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone 
could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I w
as clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?

"It is an old maxim of mine 
that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that
 it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, w
hy should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cou
sin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a dis
graceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet a
gain, my conjecture became a certainty.

"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who els
e could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your ci
rcle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a 
man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even tho
ugh he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not sa
y a word without compromising his own family.

"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I w
ent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that h
is master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a
 pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."


"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.

"Precisely. It was I. I found that I
 had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a
 prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied
 in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular t
hat had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I cla
pped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would g
ive him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'W
hy, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the address of the 
receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chafferi
ng I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got 
to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."

"A day which has saved England from a 
great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ung
rateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my 
dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my 
very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, 
"that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon 
receive a more than sufficient punishment."

XII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES


"To the man who loves art fo
r its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequ
ently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant t
o me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you 
have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so
 much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which 
may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthe
sis which I have made my special province."

"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved from th
e charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."

"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking 
up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay 
when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and 
life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reason
ing from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing."

"It seems to me that I have done
 you full justice in the matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more t
han once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.

"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," s
aid he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full justice for my art, it is beca
use it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic 
rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a
 series of tales."

It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery 
fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the oppos
ing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the whit
e cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all t
he morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having appar
ently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.

"At t
he same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the f
ire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to 
interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which 
I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected wit
h the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale o
f the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."

"The end may have bee
n so," I answered, "but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest."

"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the 
public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, 
care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the d
ays of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own
 little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to yo
ung ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning m
arks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.

It was dated from Montague Place up
on the preceding evening, and ran thus:

"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should o
r should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if
 I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,


"VIOLET HUNTER."

"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.

"Not I."


"It is half-past ten now."

"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."

"It may turn out to be of more interest tha
n you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed
 into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also."

"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soo
n be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."

As he spoke the door opened and a youn
g lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg,
 and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.

"You will excuse my troubling yo
u, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have 
no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to 
tell me what I should do."

"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you."


I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in 
his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to h
er story.

"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months
 ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, 
so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last
 the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.

"There is 
a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in 
order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business
, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employme
nt wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anyt
hing which would suit them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found 
that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled
 down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly a
t the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.

" 'That 
will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed h
is hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to l
ook at him.

" 'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

" 'Yes, sir.'

" 'As governess?'

" 'Yes, sir.'

"
 'And what salary do you ask?'

" 'I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.'

" 'Oh, tut, tut! sw
eating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. 'Ho
w could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?'

" 'My accomplishments, s
ir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'

" 'Tut, tut!' he
 cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of 
a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day pl
ay a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to c
ondescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'

"Y
ou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gent
leman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.

" 'It
 is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits 
amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may mee
t any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'

"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and
 so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there wa
s something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed m
yself.

" 'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.

" 'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five mile
s on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house
.'

" 'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'

" 'One child--one dear little romper just s
ix years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you
 could wink!' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.

"I was a little startled at the 
nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.

" 'My sole duti
es, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'

" 'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lad
y,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife mi
ght give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, he
h?'

" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'

" 'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you k
now--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our
 little whim. Heh?'

" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.

" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that wou
ld not be offensive to you?'

" 'Oh, no.'

" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'

"I could hardl
y believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of ch
estnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.

" 'I am afraid
 that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a sha
dow pass over his face as I spoke.

" 'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a little fancy of my 
wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your hair?'

" 
'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.

" 'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity
, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a f
ew more of your young ladies.'

"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either 
of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had l
ost a handsome commission through my refusal.

" 'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.

" '
If you please, Miss Stoper.'

" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in
 this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. 
Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.

"Well, Mr. Holmes,
 when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I beg
an to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expecte
d obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few gover
nesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing i
t short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by 
the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether
 the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it t
o you:


" 'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.

" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your add
ress, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you 
should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 
a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting
, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors i
n the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daught
er Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or
 amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt
 a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must 
remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, 
as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winch
ester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,


" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'

"That is the letter which I have just receiv
ed, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I
 should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."

"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that se
ttles the question," said Holmes, smiling.

"But you would not advise me to refuse?"

"I confess that it is not the s
ituation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for."

"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"

"Ah, 
I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"

"Well, there seems to me to be only o
ne possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a 
lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her 
fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"

"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it i
s the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."

"But the money, 
Mr. Holmes, the money!"

"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should th
ey give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? There must be some strong reason behind."

"I thoug
ht that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much 
stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."

"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you tha
t your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something d
istinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"

"Danger! What dange
r do you foresee?"

Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "B
ut at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from 
her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall 
write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grate
ful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said I as we heard her qui
ck, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."


"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are 
past."

It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequen
tly found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely 
woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnorm
al, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my pow
ers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an 
abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he crie
d impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his
 should ever have accepted such a situation.

The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I
 was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequ
ently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same po
sition when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message
, threw it across to me.

"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.

T
he summons was a brief and urgent one.

"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it sai
d. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.


"HUNTER."

"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.

"I should wish t
o."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at
 Winchester at 11:30."

"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as
 we may need to be at our best in the morning."

By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old 
English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire
 border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked wit
h little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was 
an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hi
lls around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the
 new foliage.

"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Ba
ker Street.

But Holmes shook his head gravely.

"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a m
ind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these 
scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a 
feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."

"Good heavens!" I cried. "W
ho would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"

"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belie
f, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful rec
ord of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."

"You horrify me!"

"But the reason is very obvious. The
 pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scre
am of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbour
s, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is b
ut a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the mos
t part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedne
ss which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help g
one to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the da
nger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."

"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she c
an get away."

"Quite so. She has her freedom."

"What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"

"I 
have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of th
ese is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, the
re is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell."

The Black Swan is an in
n of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. Sh
e had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.

"I am so delighted that you have come," she s
aid earnestly. "It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altoge
ther invaluable to me."

"Pray tell us what has happened to you."

"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have pro
mised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for
 what purpose."

"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and
 composed himself to listen.

"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatm
ent from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy 
in my mind about them."

"What can you not understand?"

"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all 
just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. I
t is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house,
 whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three side
s, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards f
rom the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's 
preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.

"I was d
riven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the chi
ld. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street
. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more tha
n thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that t
hey have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the dau
ghter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that sh
e had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite im
agine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.

"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be
 colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. 
It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes w
andered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to h
er also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some sec
ret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once 
I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon h
er mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with 
a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage f
its of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one i
dea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. Bu
t I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story."

"I am gla
d of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or not."

"I shall try not to miss an
ything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and condu
ct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, wi
th grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite dr
unk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, 
as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of 
my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.

"For two days af
ter my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfa
st and whispered something to her husband.

" 'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, Mi
ss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the ti
niest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid 
out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.'

"Th
e dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, 
but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured
 for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehe
mence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of
 the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, 
with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other 
side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine 
how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humo
ur, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour 
or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my 
dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.

"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly s
imilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the f
unny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow
-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me t
o read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the mid
dle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I
 became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I 
observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on be
hind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a h
appy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst o
f my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was b
ehind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second 
glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey sui
t, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. Th
is man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my
 handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothin
g, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose a
t once.

" 'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'

" 
'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.

" 'No, I know no one in these parts.'

" 'Dear me! How very impertinent
! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'

" 'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'

" 'No, no, we s
hould have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'

"I did as I was told, and at t
he same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in th
e window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."

"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrati
ve promises to be a most interesting one."

"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be 
little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beec
hes, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sha
rp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.

" 'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showin
g me a slit between two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'

"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and o
f a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.

" 'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which 
I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can 
do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller 
lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness' sake don't you eve
r on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is worth.'

"The warning wa
s no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. It 
was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I 
was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow o
f the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, taw
ny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished 
into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any bu
rglar could have done.

"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in
 London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I be
gan to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old c
hest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with
 my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It
 struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it.
 The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure t
hat you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.

"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same pec
uliar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hai
r have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the b
ottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordina
ry? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I
 said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which t
hey had locked.

"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan o
f the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which fa
ced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, ho
wever, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on 
his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were re
d, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and 
hurried past me without a word or a look.

"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds w
ith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were 
four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all d
eserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and 
jovial as ever.

" 'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I w
as preoccupied with business matters.'

"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to ha
ve quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'

"He looked surprised and, as it seem
ed to me, a little startled at my remark.

" 'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room u
p there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have eve
r believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion th
ere and annoyance, but no jest.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about 
that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I h
ave my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this 
place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was
 there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.

"It was only yesterday that the c
hance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserte
d rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking
 hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no dou
bt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that
 I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.

"There w
as a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round
 this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, du
sty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimme
red dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad b
ars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door i
tself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered win
dow outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there wa
s a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what 
secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward 
against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at 
the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful han
d were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into t
he arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.

" 'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it mus
t be when I saw the door open.'

" 'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.

" 'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--
you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?'

"But 
his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.

" 'I was foolish enoug
h to go into the empty wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and 
ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'

" 'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.

" 'Why, what 
did you think?' I asked.

" 'Why do you think that I lock this door?'

" 'I am sure that I do not know.'

" 'It is to
 keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.

" 'I am s
ure if I had known--'

" 'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'--here in
 an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--'I'll throw yo
u to the mastiff.'

"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him int
o my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Hol
mes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of t
he servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of co
urse I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I
 would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house
, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the d
og might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I k
new that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to
 set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no d
ifficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and
 Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I hav
e told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, abov
e all, what I should do."

Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and p
aced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.

"
Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.

"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him."

"T
hat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"

"Yes."

"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"

"Yes, the win
e-cellar."

"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. D
o you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exception
al woman."

"I will try. What is it?"

"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Ruca
stles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might gi
ve the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilit
ate matters immensely."

"I will do it."

"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there 
is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned
 in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Ru
castle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in h
eight, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she ha
s passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man 
in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and 
were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Mi
ss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prev
ent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the
 disposition of the child."

"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.

"My dear Watson, you as a medical
 man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don't you see that th
e converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying
 their children. This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this
 from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their po
wer."

"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A thousand things come back to me which make me
 certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature."

"We must be c
ircumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall 
be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery."

We were as good as our word, for it was just seve
n when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with thei
r dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even ha
d Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.

"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.

A loud thudding nois
e came from somewhere downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring on the kit
chen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's."

"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes 
with enthusiasm. "Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."

We passed up the stair, u
nlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had des
cribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without s
uccess. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.

"I trust that we are not too late,"
 said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we s
hall see whether we cannot make our way in."

It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.
 Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and 
a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.

"There has been some villainy here," said 
Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off."

"But how?"

"Through the 
skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the e
nd of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it."

"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the 
ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away."

"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever an
d dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, W
atson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."

The words were hardly out of his mouth before a 
man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed 
and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.

"You villain
!" said he, "where's your daughter?"

The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.

"It is for 
me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'
ll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.

"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss H
unter.

"I have my revolver," said I.

"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs
 together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a hor
rible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came stagge
ring out at a side door.

"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been fed for two days. Quick, qui
ck, or it'll be too late!"

Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us.
 There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and screamed upon 
the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great 
creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.
 We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did
 what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman ente
red the room.

"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.

"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he wen
t up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that you
r pains were wasted."

"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this 
matter than anyone else."

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."

"Then, pray, sit down, and l
et us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."

"I will soon make i
t clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's police
-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's fri
end too.

"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. She was sligh
ted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a frien
d's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she 
was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with
 her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, the
n her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, 
he could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks
 was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but tha
t didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."

"Ah," said Holmes, "I think 
that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains.
 Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"

"Yes, sir."

"And brought Miss Hunter down from
 London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."

"That was it, sir."

"But Mr. Fowler bei
ng a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain argume
nts, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his."

"Mr. Fowler was a very kind
-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.

"And in this way he managed that your good man should ha
ve no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."

"You have it, s
ir, just as it happened."

"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for you have certainly clear
ed up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we 
had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable 
one."

And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucast
le survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live wit
h their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.
 Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is 
now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, ra
ther to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of 
his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considera
ble success.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  
The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, e
dited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred m
illion readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per ho
ur in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are alr
eady on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the tot
al
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 
Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the prese
nt number of computer users.

PREFACE


As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in
our public sc
hools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.
Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary b
ook, which
is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
anecdotes. Second, there is the adv
anced text for the seventh or eighth
grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the
addition o
f forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high
school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten p
ath, giving
fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we
do not assume that our children 
obtain permanent possessions from their
study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the
same met
hod, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
multiplication table and fractions.

There is, of co
urse, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It
is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how lit
tle history
their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of
history will deny this. Still it 
is a standing challenge to existing
methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be
made truly p
rogressive like the study of mathematics, science, and
languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility i
n adding
their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive
historical texts are only enlarged edi
tions of the first text--more
facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp
criticism which 
it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and
economics.

In this condition of affairs we find our justificat
ion for offering a
new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one
of omission. The time-hono
red stories of exploration and the
biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know
little or
 nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John
Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useles
s to tell the
same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It
is an offense against the teache
rs of those subjects that are
demonstrated to be progressive in character.

In the next place we have omitted all des
criptions of battles. Our
reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single
battle is a highly t
echnical, and usually a highly controversial, matter
about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and 
naval
operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To
dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in
 ten lines or ten pages is
equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who
compares the ordina
ry textbook account of a single Civil War campaign
with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no fur
ther
comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
of turning to a high school manual for in
formation about the art of
warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the
interest of the immature
 pupil, seems out of place in a book that
deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's
seri
ous responsibilities.

It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is
rather upon constructi
ve features.

_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have
tried to set forth the important 
aspects, problems, and movements of
each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.

_Second._ 
We have emphasized those historical topics which help to
explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.

_T
hird._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
history, especially in relation to the politic
s of each period.

_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems
of financing and sustaining
 armed forces, rather than military strategy.
These are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These
a
re matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must
understand, if they are to play well their part in
 war and peace.

_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to
enlarge the treatment of our ow
n time. We have given special attention
to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
matter 
of sound instruction in citizenship.

_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique
characteristic
s, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we
have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and th
e
reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.

_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of ma
turity. The
study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We
have aimed to stimulate habits of an
alysis, comparison, association,
reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as
inform the m
ind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,
simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch 
the
intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them
will receive the last of their formal inst
ruction in the high school.
The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will
depend upon the po
ssession of other powers than memory alone. The
effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured b
y
the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
information.

HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES




PART I. THE COLO
NIAL PERIOD




CHAPTER I

THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA


The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of No
rth America
during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
the restless and eternal movement 
of mankind upon the surface of the
earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,
westward as
 far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into
Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Roma
ns, supported
by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the
narrow lands of Italy until it s
tretched from the heather of Scotland to
the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the
Danube 
and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the
beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of
 races and empires
the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only
one aspect of the expansio
n which finally carried the peoples, the
institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.

In one
 vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed
from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried 
with them
affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
altar of the parent city; but thousa
nds of the immigrants who came to
America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
country. They esta
blished compacts of government for themselves and set
up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till b
ut also
political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.


THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION

I
t was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of
water and found homes in the American wilderne
ss at the opening of the
seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays
of money. Stores had
 to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of the
ir own.
Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
the hazards of the new world. Soldiers 
were required for defense and
mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,
adept in manag
ing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an
enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
ge
ntleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
assume. Though in later days, after initial tes
ts had been made, wealthy
proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was
the corporation th
at furnished the capital and leadership in the
beginning.

=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration fo
und an
instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which
had long been employed in carrying on 
commerce with foreign countries.
Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
society--noble
men, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a
particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and
 sharing in
the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it
received its charter, its grant of
 land, and its trading privileges from
the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
control. The 
charter named all the persons originally included in the
corporation and gave them certain powers in the management o
f its
affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in
fact a little government set up by the ki
ng. When the members of the
corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,
they operated th
rough agents sent to the colony. When they came over the
seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Ma
ssachusetts,
they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The
stockholders in that instance becam
e the voters and the governor, the
chief magistrate.

[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY

COMPANY]

Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the
trading corporation. It was the London 
Company, created by King James I,
in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia
at Jamesto
wn. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,
chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements 
of the New
Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts
were Puritan leaders and men of affa
irs whom King Charles I incorporated
in 1629 under the title: "The governor and company of the Massachusetts
Bay in N
ew England." In this case the law did but incorporate a group
drawn together by religious ties. "We must be knit toge
ther as one man,"
wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the
south, on the banks of the D
elaware River, a Swedish commercial company
in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it
wa
s destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the
rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony 
of Delaware.

In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the "company
colonies." It was, however, originally c
onceived by the moving spirit,
James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned
for debt. To 
realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George
II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, incl
uding
himself, into "one body politic and corporate," known as the "Trustees
for establishing the colony of Georgia i
n America." In the structure of
their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not
differ mater
ially from the regular companies created for trade and
colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their tra
nsactions
had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.

=The Religious Congregation.=--A 
second agency which figured largely in
the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or
congregation, of m
en and women brought together in the bonds of a common
religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, th
is
institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a
potent force in the origin and growth of se
lf-government in a land far
away from Galilee. "And the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one 
soul," we are told in the Acts describing the Church at
Jerusalem. "We are knit together as a body in a most sacred c
ovenant of
the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
care of each other's good and of th
e whole," wrote John Robinson, a
leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in
1620. The May
flower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a
written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of ob
edience to
the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until
Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in
 1691.

[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]

Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve

of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the
congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connectic
ut, and New
Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by
small bodies of men and women, "unit
ed in solemn covenants with the
Lord," who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a
year after R
oger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers
to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a ch
arter of
incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation
of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blaze
d the way into the Connecticut River
Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own
(1662) and 
a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the
towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants f
rom Massachusetts
were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.

Even when Connecticut was chartered,
 the parchment and sealing wax of
the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government
and obedienc
e to law previously established by the congregations. The
towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived
 happily
under their "Fundamental Orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had
the settlers dwelt peacefully at New
 Haven under their "Fundamental
Articles" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut
shore had no diff
iculty in agreeing that "the Scriptures do hold forth a
perfect rule for the direction and government of all men."

=
The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the
proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associa
ted with the word
"property," implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king
granted property in lands in Nort
h America to have, hold, use, and enjoy
for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down
to his
 heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and
powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capi
tal, collect the
ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found
and sustain a plantation beyo
nd the seas. Sometimes the proprietor
worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
common
 undertaking.

Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,
owe their formal origins, though
 not always their first settlements, nor
in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,
establi
shed in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and
blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flo
urished under
the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American
union. New Jersey, beginning its c
areer under two proprietors, Berkeley
and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown
in 1702.
 Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the
generous spirit and tireless labors of its first propr
ietor, the leader
of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
whose family it remained until 
1776. The two Carolinas were first
organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of
eight propri
etors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a
century both became royal provinces governed by the king.

THE COLONIAL PEOPLES

=The English.=--In leadership and 
origin the thirteen colonies, except
New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save
these tw
o, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from
England. The colonists came from every walk of life. Th
ey were men,
women, and children of "all sorts and conditions." The major portion
were yeomen, or small land owners, 
farm laborers, and artisans. With
them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
their fortun
es to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and
Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son o
f an
English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
America. The people represented every relig
ious faith--members of the
Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that
church; Separatists
, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;
and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.

New 
England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and
1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government,
 about twenty thousand
Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far
North. Although minor addit
ions were made from time to time, the greater
portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.
Virg
inia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did
 other
nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in
numbers.

The populations of later En
glish colonies--the Carolinas, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of
immigration fr
om England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from
the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from 
New England
in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that
"free thinking spreads almost as 
fast as the Church." North Carolina was
first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.
Some of
 the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the
way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long e
nough to learn how
little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.

=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numb
ers and influence were
the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both
religious and economic reas
ons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch
ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland
wh
ence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There
the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in
 peace their own form of
religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
woolen cloth. Then the 
blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth
century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of

their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades
twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alon
e, for America; and all
during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.
Although no exact record w
as kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish
and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of
t
he entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.

[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH
IM
MIGRANTS]

These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and t
he Carolinas. Coming late upon
the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
already taken up.
 For this reason most of them became frontier people
settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the
 land,
laid out their small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the soil,"
hardy, industrious, and independent in 
spirit, sharing neither the
luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
merchants. To their agri
culture they added woolen and linen
manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
women, m
ade heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in
the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:

        
"O, willing hands to toil;
    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;
    Bold pionee
rs for the wilderness, defenders in the field."

=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical
impo
rtance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in
colonial records. A number of the artisans and car
penters in the first
Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous
governor of New Motherland, wa
s a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and
Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
administra
tion of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The
wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of 
Pennsylvania.
Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
lands and he made a special effort 
to attract peasants from the Rhine
country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought
more than twe
nty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants.
 In old
New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for
distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia
 inducements were offered
to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in
time, German settleme
nts. In fact the migration became so large that
German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
En
gland was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By th
e end of the
colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two
hundred thousand.

The majority of the
m were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South
Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty d
rove
them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also
among them skilled artisans who contrib
uted to the rapid growth of
industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,
dotted here and t
here among the thickly settled regions, added to the
wealth and independence of the province.

A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]

Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the
or
iginal colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,
built their own schools, founded their own news
papers, and published
their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
and led to occasional ag
itations against "foreigners." However, no
serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the
Revolutio
n, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot
armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Sco
tch-Irish
sections.

=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the
Germans made up the bulk o
f the colonial population, there were other
racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing

their share to colonial life.

From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
inflicted ter
rible penalties upon Protestants.

From "Old Ireland" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and
Catholic in 
religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,
they revered neither the government nor the church of Engla
nd imposed
upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping
records of the colonial period show tha
t boatload after boatload left
the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.
Undoubtedly thousands of
 their passengers were Irish of the native
stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
Celtic
 names in the records of various colonies.

OLD DUTCH FORT AND ENGLISH CHURCH NEAR
 ALBANY]

The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious
and economic toleration, found in the
 American colonies, not complete
liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,
France, Spain, or 
Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize
their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the ea
sy-going
habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
towns. The treatment they received the
re varied. On one occasion the
mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on
another prohibited
 the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,
Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large

Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,
flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions
 of the law.

Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged
beneath the tide of English migration
, the Dutch in New York continued
to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English
conquest in 1664.
 At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the
170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the o
riginal
Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
manners of New York. Many of them clung a
s tenaciously to their mother
tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;
but they were sl
owly losing their identity as the English pressed in
beside them to farm and trade.

The melting pot had begun its hi
storic mission.


THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION

Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the
em
igrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay
for their passage, to sustain them on the voya
ge, and to start them on
the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,
Scotch-Irish, Germans,
 and all were alike laid.

=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America
in colonial days w
ere capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,
and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists w
ere able
to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.
Undoubtedly a very considerable numbe
r could do so, for we can trace the
family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority
for the st
atement that "the settlers of New England were drawn from the
country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the m
other
country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists
show, and all of them, with few exceptio
ns, were men of property and
good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration
is usually suppl
ied, for they all had a stake in the country they left
behind." Though it would be interesting to know how accurate t
his
statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as
yet been made to gratify that interest. For
 the present it is an
unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
cost of their own transfe
r to the New World.

=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants
were unable to pay for the
ir passage is established beyond the shadow of
a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great
b
arrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost
of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty
 a plan was worked out
whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
money to immigrants in ret
urn for their promise, or bond, to work for a
term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called
indentu
red servitude.

It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
twenty thousand Puritans, the y
eomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the
Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to
Georgia w
ere to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
women, and children serving out terms of bondage general
ly ranging from
five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
servants was very high. The B
altimores, Penns, Carterets, and other
promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
their fiel
ds, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were 
flung wide open.
Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,
and special efforts were made 
to increase the population by importing
servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with
fifty bo
nd servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds
of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the 
opening of the
eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.
In the other Middle colonies th
e number was doubtless not so large; but
it formed a considerable part of the population.

The story of this traffic 
in white servants is one of the most striking
things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the

feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.
They likewise differed from the negro slaves in
 that their servitude had
a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It
was, for instance, a
 common practice to impose on them penalties far
heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free

citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of 
the same unlawful conduct
was whipped at the post and fined as well.

The ordinary life of the white servant was also
 severely restricted. A
bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in
trade; nor refuse work as
signed to him. For an attempt to escape or
indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.
Th
e condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, "was
little better than that of slaves. Loose indenture
s and harsh laws put
them at the mercy of their masters." It would not be unfair to add that
such was their lot in al
l other colonies. Their fate depended upon the
temper of their masters.

Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gav
e thousands of people in the
Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate
for freedom and
 a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude
were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of thei
r own or
settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble
proved to be a losing venture because h
e found himself unable to rise
out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
carried him. For t
housands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real
avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of
 America
have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.

=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their a
nxiety to secure
settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America
either resorted to or connived at
 the practice of kidnapping men, women,
and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was
officially es
timated that "ten thousand persons were spirited away" to
America. Many of the victims of the practice were young chi
ldren, for
the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were
sometimes disposed of in America by
 relatives unwilling to support them.
In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
Virginia
.

In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few
romances. Parents were separated from their ch
ildren and husbands from
their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and
weavers--utterly disappea
red as if swallowed up by death. A few thus
dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of
five
 or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly car
ried over the sea
lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a
peerage.

Akin to the kidnapped,
 at least in economic position, were convicts
deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. Th
e
Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.
Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for man
y of the "criminals" were
only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant
caught shooting a rabbit
 on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl
who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along wi
th
sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders
were "political criminals"; that is, persons 
who criticized or opposed
the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against
British rule in Ireland;
 now Cavaliers who championed the king against
the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the
mo
narchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who
joined in political uprisings against the king.


=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
indentured servants and whites carried to Amer
ica against their will
were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When
this form of bondage w
as first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was
looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the incre
ase
of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters
who first bought negroes at the auction 
block intended to establish a
system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery
take firm root 
and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slav
ery, there
were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.

The great increase in later years was due in no small measu
re to the
inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in
New England. Finding it relatively
 easy to secure negroes in Africa,
they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal
African Comp
any sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England w
ere not far
behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.

As the proportion of the negroes to
 the free white population steadily
rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,
the South
ern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail
the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave.
 This effort was
futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time
similar bills were passed, only
 to meet with royal disapproval. South
Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure
was kill
ed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted
by a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petitio
n in this vein:
"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa
hath long been considered as a 
trade of great inhumanity and under its
present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger
the ver
y existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply
impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Y
our Majesty to
remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony
which inhibit their assenting t
o such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerce."

All such protests were without avail. The negro populatio
n grew by leaps
and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than
half a million. In five state
s--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,
and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
in 
number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the
population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware an
d Pennsylvania
about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the
proportion of slaves steadily d
iminished although chattel servitude was
on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one
in 
six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few
freedmen.

The climate, the soil, the commerce, and
 the industry of the North were
all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,
though section
al, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern
ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the prod
uce of the
plantations to Europe. "If the Northern states will consult their
interest, they will not oppose the incre
ase in slaves which will
increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers," said
John Rutledge, of Sou
th Carolina, in the convention which framed the
Constitution of the United States. "What enriches a part enriches the

whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,"
responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguishe
d spokesman of Connecticut.

CHAPTER II

COLONIAL AGRICULTURE, INDUST
RY, AND COMMERCE

THE LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT


=The Significance of Land Tenure.=--The way in which land may 
be
acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
deep influence on the life and culture of a p
eople. The feudal and
aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism
which was characterize
d by two distinct features. In the first place,
the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single

proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the
law of primogeniture, which at the death of 
a lord transferred all his
landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of
estates and the growt
h of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude
inev
itable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also
enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power a
s a governing
class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
political control. If land tenure
 was so significant in Europe, it was
equally important in the development of America, where practically all
the firs
t immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
livelihood from the soil.

=Experiments in Common Tillage.=
--In the New World, with its broad
extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to
introduce in it
s entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that a
lmost
every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,
was tried. In the early days of the James
town colony, the land, though
owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No
man had a separat
e plot of his own. The motto of the community was:
"Labor and share alike." All were supposed to work in the fields a
nd
receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims
attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fi
elds in common and
distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
the workers.

In both colo
nies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the
lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet 
expected regular
meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: "Everyone that gathereth
not every day as much as I do
, the next day shall be set beyond the
river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve." Even
this 
terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until
each man was given a plot of his own to till, not unt
il each gathered
the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where
the communal experiment last
ed for five years, the results were similar
to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate
fie
lds in which every person could "set corn for his own particular."
Some other New England towns, refusing to profit b
y the experience of
their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and
labor, only to abandon th
e idea and go in for individual ownership of
the land. "By degrees it was seen that even the Lord's people could not

carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
practice."

=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--
Quit Rents, Manors, and
Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
land tenure found in
 the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions
of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was i
n fact
a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He
could retain any part of it for his pe
rsonal use or dispose of it all in
large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of
baronial pro
portions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any
considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequentl
y he either
sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
condition that they make to him an annua
l payment in money, known as
"quit rent." In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
$9000 (equal to 
about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this
source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual
t
ribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,
the king of England claimed all revenues collec
ted in this form from the
land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit
rent,--"really a f
eudal payment from freeholders,"--was thus a material
source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. 
Wherever
it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant
irritation; and it became a formidable 
item in the long list of
grievances which led to the American Revolution.

Something still more like the feudal syste
m of the Old World appeared in
the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the
companies, or
 the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there
were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by weal
thy men and
tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
tenure. In New York also there were m
any manors of wide extent, most of
which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when
extensive conce
ssions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Li
vingston
manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
representative to the provincial legislat
ure. The tenants on the New
York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European
estates. They wer
e bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they
ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his 
judicial
power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances
extending to capital punishment.

The m
anors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence
as compared with the vast plantations of the South
ern seaboard--huge
estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by
slaves more servile than a
ny feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten
that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
se
ction and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
America.

[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANS
ION]

=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and
throughout most of the North, the drift
 was against all forms of
servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,
the small farm owned 
outright and tilled by the possessor and his
family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the

immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
labor made it impossible for the companies, the 
proprietors, or the
crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In
many sections, particular
ly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,
the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within 
a
moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and
German peasants, even if they had been tenants 
in the Old World, did not
propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they
could not get freeho
lds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced
proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling 
land in
small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
became the cherished unit of American farm
ers. The people who tilled the
farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold
system gave a 
uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.

=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western
settlement thus developed two distinct 
types of people engaged in the
same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both
cultivated the soil
 and possessed the local interest and independence
which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,

however, differed widely.

The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the
English landlord
 on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sol
d his rice
and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his
entire crop in exchange for goods a
nd cash. His fine clothes,
silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the
ripe old culture o
f the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford
or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very l
argely for
his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
Old World. He did not even need mar
ket towns in which to buy native
goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
were usually
 gifted slaves.

The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His
crops were not big enough to w
arrant direct connection with English
factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed
local mar
kets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,
weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns s
upplied him
with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought
by the rich planter in England, th
e small farmer ordinarily could not
buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and
between him and
 the European market stood the merchant. His community
was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of g
reat
plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,
more American. The planter faced the Old E
ast. The farmer faced the New
West.

=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
one resp
ect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of
an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and 
south, as soon as
a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration
set in westward, creeping th
rough forests, across rivers, and over
mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap
lands, were
 compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path
breakers to the West were native Americans of the second
 and third
generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the
mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur trader
s, and squatters, following
their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back
stories of the ne
w regions they traversed. Then came the regular
settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometime
s
singly and sometimes in companies.

In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
Springfi
eld in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the
eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pu
shed north and west
until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New
York, the inland movemen
t was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,
and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,
particul
arly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early
filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present ci
ty of New
Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In
Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways d
etermined the main lines of
advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,
spread over the ferti
le lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying
out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by th
e
Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the 
southern tier of counties
a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching
the upper waters of t
he Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn
family.

In the South the westward march was equally swift. The sea
board was
quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Pie
dmont Plateau, lying back from
the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams
of migration, o
ne westward from the sea and the other southward from the
other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish 
furnishing
the main supply. "By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing
and the 'back country' of the Blue 
Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully
occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.
Before th
e Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of
home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies."

[Illustr
ation: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]

Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an
invasi
on that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As
early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious
 to hunt
buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the
Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a
 wonderful country awaiting the
plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers
followed the t
rail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the
Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier

times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbrea
k of the Revolution
there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older
colonists, they did not 
relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked
the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the
C
ontinental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
fourteenth colony."


INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL D
EVELOPMENT

Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was
a steady growth in industrial an
d commercial pursuits. Most of the
staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their
beginnings
 in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion
 to their
numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
originated in the days when the king of 
England was "lord of these
dominions."

[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]

=Textile Manufactu
re as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in
addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy lab
or
of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry
which was almost exclusively their own. Woo
l and flax were raised in
abundance in the North and South. "Every farm house," says Coman, the
economic historian, "
was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wea
r."
By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth
in sufficient quantities to export it to 
the Southern colonies and to
the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the
more difficult pr
ocess of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and
spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Ne
therland,
the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior "were not
one whit behind their Yankee neighbo
rs."

The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be
overestimated. For many a century the 
English had employed their fine
woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the
government had
 come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
protection. When the colonies were established, both merch
ants and
statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;
but before long the Americans, inst
ead of buying cloth, especially of
the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of
customers, here wer
e rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon
English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.

If Bri
tish merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
trade, observant officers in the provinces would have 
conveyed the news
to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
governor of New York wrote of 
the industrious Americans to his home
government: "The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
once, n
ot only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of
England, they who already are not very fond of submittin
g to government
will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
in their breasts. This will 
not seem strange when you consider what sort
of people this country is inhabited by."

=The Iron Industry.=--Almost e
qually widespread was the art of iron
working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
industries. Lynn,
 Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within
fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of i
ron began
at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,
Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barr
ington, Massachusetts, in
1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had
iron works at Shrew
sbury within ten years after the founding of the
colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware 
and
the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then
laid the foundations of fortunes in a regio
n destined to become one of
the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the
year that saw the
 introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon
lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.

Governor Spotswood was called the "Tubal Cain" of the Old Dominion
because he placed the industry on a firm foundati
on. Indeed it seems
that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,
metallic ware, chains, anch
ors, bar and pig iron were made in large
quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the
colonists t
o export rough iron to the British Islands.

=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,
ship
building was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak
for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpen
tine, and hemp for rope
made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a
ship was built at Ne
w Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century
shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,
S
alem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.
Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built
 ships for the trade
of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia
soon entered the race an
d outdistanced New York, though unable to equal
the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South
Caro
lina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the
lucrative business of producing ship materials: f
ir, cedar, hemp, and
tar.

=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside
of agriculture wa
s the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy
sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flouri
shed
under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the
net and the harpoon in almost every quart
er of the Atlantic. "Look,"
exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, "at the manner in
which the people of Ne
w England have of late carried on the whale
fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
be
hold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay
and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for 
them beneath the arctic
circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
cold, that they are 
at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging

to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst
some of them draw the line and strike the har
poon on the coast of
Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
the coast of Brazil. No se
a but what is vexed by their fisheries. No
climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of
Ho
lland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
of English enterprise ever carried this most per
ilous mode of hard
industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
people."

The influence of the b
usiness was widespread. A large and lucrative
European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught

for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or
exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the A
merican market. The
lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave
consumption, and in part traded fo
r sugar and molasses, which furnished
the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These
activitie
s, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and t
hus keeping the
shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport
towns rushed with work. They als
o increased trade with the mother
country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and
the West I
ndies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an
ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around
 this single
industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.

=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=
--All through the eighteenth
century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction
until it rivale
d in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,
and the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A
 modern
historian has said: "The enterprising merchants of New England developed
a network of trade routes that cover
ed well-nigh half the world." This
commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
mother coun
try, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.

On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and
agricult
ural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,
tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, 
grain, flour,
furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,
and small articles of manufact
ure. The variety of products was in fact
astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an
American un
ion, once remarked of colonial trade: "What sort of dish will
you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. Th
e middle states,
flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North
Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpent
ine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,
and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an
absurd ju
mble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces."


On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,
consisting principally of English and continental m
anufactures, tea, and
"India goods." Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,
supplied the flourishing disti
lleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern
colonies 
engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of
pounds of her capital.

The disposition of imported goods 
in the colonies, though in part
controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large
and important
 body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises
of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Bos
ton; and the
Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they
were worthy rivals of their English
 competitors, so celebrated for
world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages
they enjoyed i
n British markets and under the protection of the British
navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettles
ome, ready to
contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests
against outside interference.

[Illus
tration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM
(NEW YORK CITY)]

Measured against the immense business of m
odern times, colonial commerce
seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its
significance. It must be 
considered in relation to the growth of English
colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a fe
w
startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to
the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On 
the eve of the American
Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies
alone amounted to $6,02
4,000; in other words, almost as much as the
whole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first
d
ate, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;
at the second date, it was considerably more 
than one-third. In 1704,
Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in
1772 the purchases 
of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,
Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight year
s,
amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the
colonies at the opening of the century. The 
American colonies were
indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.

=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the
 bad roads of colonial times made
overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and
harbors along the
 coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the
colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rive
rs in
the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for
goods to be brought from, and carried t
o, the interior regions in little
sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,
domestic and
 foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,
or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports,
 and sailed up
the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
the raw materials which they h
ad gathered in from neighboring farms.
Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New
England
 to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,
leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along 
the Connecticut
shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to
Maryland, Virginia, and the dis
tant Carolinas.

=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry
there grew up along the coas
t a number of prosperous commercial centers
which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
Br
itish empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical rec
ords of that time are
mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among
these towns. Serving as
 the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the
R
evolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with
somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the 
"commercial capital of
Connecticut and old East Jersey," was slightly smaller than Boston, but
growing at a steady ra
te. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South
Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a

center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were cou
nted as "considerable
towns." In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in
Pennsylvania, and Alban
y in New York, with growing populations and
increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the
seaboar
d. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,
Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in wh
ich dwelt a
dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county
seats often consisted of nothing
 more than a log courthouse, a prison,
and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the
sessio
ns of the court.

The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
proportion to their populat
ion. They were the centers of wealth, for one
thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and

artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
from their commercial operations. The towns 
were also centers for news,
gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market
places the farmers
 from the countryside learned of British policies and
laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the m
ain
currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
independence.

Chapter III

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS


Colonial life, crowded as it was with hard and unremitting to
il, left
scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. There was
little money in private purses or publ
ic treasuries to be dedicated to
schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long
and widely, a
nd fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as 
the
intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic
efforts were made in every community to 
lift the people above the plane
of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests
those efforts
 were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the
thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the 
struggle with
England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,
political philosophy, and the arts
 of war, government, and diplomacy
itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American
intellect. No o
ne, not even the most critical, can run through the
writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts 
to
Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,
Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall,
 Henry, the Randolphs,
and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was
something in American colon
ial life which fostered minds of depth and
power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
proc
ess of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is
evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs
. John Adams to her
husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,
the sister of James Otis, 
who measured her pen with the British
propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.


THE L
EADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES

In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high
importance. There
 were abundant reasons for this. In many of the
colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impu
lse
had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all
the colonies, the clergy, at least in th
e beginning, formed the only
class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached
on Sundays and 
taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of
local problems and in the formation of political opinion, s
o much of
which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They
wrote books and pamphlets. They filled
 most of the chairs in the
colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the
Americans received thei
r formal education. In several of the provinces
the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Purita
ns
were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
authority. In the Middle colonies, partic
ularly, the multiplication of
sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in
all of them ther
e was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in
time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.


=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English
system of church and state. The Anglican faith a
nd worship were
prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the
governor, the provincial cou
ncilors, and the richest planters. "The
Established Church," says Lodge, "was one of the appendages of the
Virginia a
ristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,
and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estat
e of the
planter who built and managed it." As in England, Catholics and
Protestant Dissenters were at first laid und
er heavy disabilities. Only
slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when
once they were even
 covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,
by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the establ
ished
order.

The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgi
a after that colony passed directly
under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of
the inhab
itants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics
it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, t
oo,
notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was
fostered by the provincial officials, and
 the Anglicans, embracing about
one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of
proportion to their 
numbers.

Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the
colonies. It was supported by the Bri
tish government and the official
class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England
were appoint
ed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by
acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the Engli
sh monarchy, it
could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
counteract to some extent the indepe
ndent spirit that was growing up in
America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had
a politi
cal role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing
leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of
 the eighteenth
century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
Church in provincial affairs. Unh
appily for their plans they failed to
calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
Protestants, w
ho still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
in the mother country.

=Puritanism in New England.=--If th
e established faith made for imperial
unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims
had cast
 off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a
separate and independent congregation before they came t
o America. The
Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,
soon after their arrival in Massa
chusetts, likewise flung off their yoke
of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was
organiz
ed, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
other officers. They also composed the voters in the 
town meeting, where
secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was
thus complete, and unifor
mity of faith and life prescribed by law and
enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy
instea
d of imperial unity.

The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and
their fearful denunciat
ions of the faithless. They wrote the books for
the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and

eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the
civil officers they enforced a strict observ
ance of the Puritan
Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and
lasted until sunset on S
unday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and
all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hou
rs.
A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
was in danger of being banished as a vaga
bond. Robert Pike, a devout
Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback
one Sunday evenin
g and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought
 into court
and fined for "his ungodly conduct." With persons accused of witchcraft
the Puritans were still more ruth
less. When a mania of persecution swept
over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed
to d
eath, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.

Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uni
formity of
Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it
with disfavor, and in 1684 King Char
les II annulled the old charter of
the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later
wrested fro
m the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king.
 It also
abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting
for it a simple property qualificat
ion. Thus a royal governor and an
official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
sympathies, 
were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious
denominations, if they had the required amount of proper
ty, were
permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the
crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken d
own in Massachusetts, and that
province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
Hampshire, wher
e property, not religious faith, was the test for the
suffrage.

=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither th
e Anglicans of
Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for
other denominations, that princi
ple was strictly applied in Rhode
Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in
matters of consci
ence was established in the beginning. Maryland, by
granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jes
us
Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to
the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of c
onscience to those "who
confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the
creator, upholder, and rul
er of the World." By one circumstance or
another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
rath
er than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,
Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians,
 Lutherans,
Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
too widely scattered to permit any 
one of them to rule, if it had
desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where
one or anothe
r church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature
steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged d
iversity,
and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.

The government and faith of the dissenting denomina
tions conspired with
economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English
state. Presbyterians, Qu
akers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy
of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London
.
Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
articles of faith. Local self-government in m
atters ecclesiastical
helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The
spirit of independence
 which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,
nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, 
made
them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
authority imposed from without.


SCHOOLS AND CO
LLEGES

=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant
denomination was the education of th
e children in the faith. In this
work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was
indeed the one
 book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of lab
or, found in
the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a
book of romance, travel, and his
tory. "Legend and annal," says John
Richard Green, "war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty
voices o
f prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission
journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philoso
phic arguments,
apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
the most part by any rival le
arning.... As a mere literary monument, the
English version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English
t
ongue." It was the King James version just from the press that the
Pilgrims brought across the sea with them.

For th
e authority of the Established Church was substituted the
authority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechi
sm based upon
their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in
America, they ordered all pare
nts and masters of servants to be diligent
in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
work
s and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was
scarcely twenty years old before education of this c
haracter was
declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools
where those not taught at home coul
d receive instruction in reading and
writing.

Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
with the same 
favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
little schools kept by "dames, itinerant teachers, or local pa
rsons."
Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in
the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses
, where boys, and sometimes
girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,
fathers and mothers of
 the better kind gave their children the rudiments
of learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence t
o show
that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
progress all through the eighteenth century
.

=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the
establishment of colleges as well as local sch
ools. Harvard, founded in
1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train
"learned and godly ministe
rs" for the Puritan churches of New England.
To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a

mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England
farmers preparing to preach, teach, or pract
ice law. The College of New
Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,
was sustained by t
he Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the
Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William
a
nd Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia
University, chartered by King George II in 175
4, on an appeal from the
New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
"republican tendencie
s" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away
from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and 
the
Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,
organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the
 spirit of toleration by
giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
sects. It was Franklin's
 idea that his college should prepare young men
to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
t
heir country.

=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of
learning, higher education was b
y no means confined within their walls.
Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in
England. P
rivate tutoring in the home was common. In still more families
there were intelligent children who grew up in the gre
at colonial school
of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind
and wit, they could vie wi
th the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or
any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose
char
ming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a
fine record of self-education. His formal training
 in the classroom was
limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his
self-education continued throughout
 his life. He early manifested a zeal
for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on
theology, B
unyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's
_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes de
aling with
secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,
Franklin acquired by the diligent and 
repeated analysis of the
_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely
in natural science 
and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of
European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own 
efforts
he "attained an acquaintance" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,
thus unconsciously preparing himself 
for the day when he was to speak
for all America at the court of the king of France.

Lesser lights than Franklin, ed
ucated by the same process, were found
all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,
self-e
ducated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of
the Revolution.


THE COLONIAL PRESS

=The Rise of t
he Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a
government by public opinion, enlightened by the open disc
ussion of
political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That
too, like education, was a matter 
of slow growth. A printing press was
brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an
official censor
 and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty
years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing 
the curious
title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not
been running very long before the g
overnment of Massachusetts suppressed
it for discussing a political question.

Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a pre
carious business; but in 1704
there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,
which proved to be
 a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languishe
d. When
Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_
about 1720, his friends sought to dissuad
e him, saying that one
newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his
confidence in the futu
re was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette
or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjami
n
Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five
newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had
 three: two in English
and one in German.

=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,
unlicense
d by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,
however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American c
olonies had
never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,
pamphlets, broadsides, and newspa
pers. When the art of printing was
first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical
authorities. Af
ter the establishment of the State Church in England in
the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part
 of royal
prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;
and no one could publish anything wi
thout previous approval of the
official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,
with a zeal which
 rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence
royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After
 the
restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed
in royal hands, where it remained until 1
695, when Parliament, by
failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official

censorship. By that
 time political parties were so powerful and so
active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of 
all
published matter became a sheer impossibility.

In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connect
ion
with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less
anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop
 of London to shut out from
the prying eyes of the people all literature "not mete for them to
read"; and so they est
ablished a system of official licensing for
presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was
m
ore diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
impunity, they were nevertheless constantly lia
ble to arrest for
printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the
editor of the _Mercury_ in P
hiladelphia was called before the
proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,
and for a lat
er offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.
A still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New Y
ork publisher,
who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who
ventured to defend the unluck
y editor were deprived of their licenses to
practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
P
hiladelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the
approbation of the public was forthcoming when the
 lawyer for the
defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not
that of the poor printer, wa
s on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it
finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.
Alread
y the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing
is the freedom of the press.

Thanks to the schools,
 few and scattered as they were, and to the
vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of
t
he colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
almanacs that streamed from the types, the people cou
ld follow the
course of public events and grasp the significance of political
arguments. An American opinion was in t
he process of making--an
independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
around the fireside a
nd at the taverns. When the day of resistance to
British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every pers
on
who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a
thousand who could see their appeals on t
he printed page. Men who had
spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's
Almanac_ lived to
 read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.


THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS

Two very distinct lines of de
velopment appeared in colonial politics.
The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the
drift to
ward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-
government, was
the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each
movement gave impetus to the other,
 with increasing force during the
passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals
of governme
nt came in the war of independence.

=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were
royal provin
ces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia
passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when t
he charter of
the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost
its charter in 1684, and the ne
w instrument granted seven years later
stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In
the ea
rly decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were
given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. N
ew Hampshire,
severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the
trustees in 1752, went into the han
ds of the crown. New York,
transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,
became a province w
hen he took the title of James II in 1685. New
Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was

brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
Delaware, although they retained their proprieta
ry character until the
Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their
governors were as indepen
dent of popular choice as were the appointees
of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,
retain
ed full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone
had governors and legislatures entirely of their own
 choosing.

The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed
high and important powers which he 
naturally sought to augment at every
turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,
appointed
 the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and
reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commande
r-in-chief
of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
time of invasion, war, and rebell
ion. In all the provinces, except
Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
the legislat
ure and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.
He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly
, or the lower
house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and
he vetoed measures which he tho
ught objectionable. Here were in America
all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had
protested an
d Cromwell had battled in England.

[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]

The colonial governors 
were generally surrounded by a body of
office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen
of brok
en estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The
pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerve
s, and privileges
granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen
popular antipathy to the Bri
tish government. Favors extended to
adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The
reappearance of th
is formidable union of church and state, from which
they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combin
ation.

=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward
administration through royal governors was the sec
ond and opposite
tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.
The voters of England had long
 been accustomed to share in taxation and
law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early
in
troduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
its first representative assembly appeared. As th
e towns of
Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
the corporation to meet at one pl
ace, the representative idea was
adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative
system unde
r their "Fundamental Orders" of 1639, and the entire colony
was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as
 practical
considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William
Penn to invite their colonists to s
hare in the government as soon as any
considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every
one of
 the colonies secured a popular assembly.

It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was
f
inally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the
 rural voter had to
be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no
house on it, or twenty-five 
acres with a house twenty-five feet square.
In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter

of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
at least or of other property to the value o
f forty pounds sterling. In
Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
or more of land 
well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons
worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.

Restrictions li
ke these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and art
isans of
the towns, who were by no means content with their position.
Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any ma
n to acquire a small
freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion
of the colonists were l
and owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the
limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.

The popular character
 of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called 
upon by
the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,
the legislature took advantage of the 
opportunity to make terms in the
interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of
money to pay off
icial salaries and then insisted upon electing a
treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the
mys
teries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious
officials. The legislature also used its power over 
money grants to
force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.

=Contests between Legislature
s and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many
and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors

and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how
the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bi
ll for the executive to
sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly
humor, Franklin adds
: "Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our
proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings i
n
legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own
before can be had for ready money. It is ano
ther addition to the value
of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so
blessed."

It must n
ot be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily
as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legisl
atures, like
Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
executive prerogatives as they t
ried out and found their strength. If
we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America
was dimi
nishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the
friends of the governor complained in 1747 that "the inh
abitants of
plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon
republican principles all is conducted.
 Little more than a shadow of
royal authority remains in the Northern colonies." "Here," echoed the
governor of South
 Carolina, the following year, "levelling principles
prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a govern
or, if
he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their
whole administration in their hands; th
e election of the members of the
assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical
preferments, are
 in the disposal or election of the people."

Though baffled by the "levelling principles" of the colonial assemblies
,
the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved
a system of policy and action which they t
hought could bring the
obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters
to the government in L
ondon, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal
officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatur
es
by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was
to be maintained in America; (3) the remai
ning colonial charters were to
be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.

Such a system
 seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many
ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and
 an army
independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry
out both royal orders and acts of Parl
iament. This reasoning seemed both
practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh
from the go
vernors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It
failed to take account of the fact that the American peopl
e were growing
strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the
tutelage of the British ministry
, no matter how excellent it might be or
how benevolent its intentions.

CHAPTER IV

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM


It is one of the well-known facts of history that a peopl
e loosely
united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a
people torn by domestic strife, may be w
elded into a solid and compact
body by an attack from a foreign power. The imperative call to common
defense, the hab
it of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common
service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting
 outside
interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,
perhaps, the most discordant. The pre
sence of the enemy allays the most
virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. "Politics," runs an old
saying, "stops
 at the water's edge."

This ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic
circles, applied nearly as
 well to the original thirteen American
colonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common
defense, if 
not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it
has long been the practice to speak of the early settleme
nts as founded
in "a wilderness," this was not actually the case. From the earliest
days of Jamestown on through the 
years, the American people were
confronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements
were Indians, gr
owing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the 
south and
west was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to
the Armada, but still presenting an
 imposing front to the British
empire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,
imperial in tempe
r, and prepared to contest on land and water the
advance of British dominion in America.


RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS
 AND THE FRENCH

=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the
relations of the colonists t
o the Indians. The problem was presented in
different shape in different sections of America. It was not handled
acco
rding to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,
which alone could speak for all the provinces at the
 same time. Neither
did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an
irregular train, have the 
consistent policy or the matured experience
necessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties
aro
se mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
were making their way with gun and ax, nearly eve
rything that happened
was the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel
between traders and an 
Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the
exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad tem
per
often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.

On one side of the ledger may be set innu
merable generous records--of
Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of
Roger Williams buyin
g his lands from the friendly natives; or of William
Penn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other 
side of
the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
frontier rolled westward with deadly prec
ision. The Pequots on the
Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements
with awful fury in 1
637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A
generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of t
he
Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
the strength of all New England to the fiel
d and ended in his own
destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially
with the Algonquins and t
he Mohawks, were marked by periodic and
desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New
Engla
nd. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the
Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and 
in 1644 he
attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.
Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted 
to stir the colonial governor to put up
an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt
and a 
successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia
outposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife wi
th the natives
was transferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to the
southeast, a desperate struggle with th
e Tuscaroras called forth the
combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.

VIRGINIANS DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INDIANS]

From such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on accou
nt of their
geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of
conciliation, was likewise spared
 until her western vanguard came into
full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever
negotiatio
ns and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms
with her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither dip
lomacy nor
generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,
especially after the French soldie
rs enlisted the Indians in their
imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general
warfare.

1750]

=Early Relations with the French.=--During 
the first decades of French
exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English
colonies, engrossed w
ith their own problems, gave little or no thought
to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, 
in
1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in
strength to be much of a menace to Boston, Har
tford, or New York. It was
the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in
America, who first grasp
ed the significance of the slowly converging
empires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,
ra
ther than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that
sounded the first note of colonial alarm.

Evide
nce of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
English and the French occurred before their advancing 
frontiers met on
the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's
War (1701-1713), and King Geor
ge's War (1744-1748) owed their origins
and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European
powers, a
lthough they all involved the American colonies in struggles
with the French and their savage allies.

=The Clash in 
the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly
closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began
 to be
seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the
West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened th
e Lake region, and La Salle,
who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed
by the builders
 of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus
taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well 
as the St.
Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they
occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they forma
lly announced their dominion
over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this
lofty claim, they
 set out to make it good by constructing in the years
1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upp
er
waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the
streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warne
d by George Washington,
in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory "so
notoriously known to be
 property of the crown of Great Britain," the
French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.

BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]

=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that th
e
shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French
and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pe
nnsylvania. There began the
conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved
England and Prussia, on
 the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and
minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in

1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the
dramatic features. On the continent of Europe
, England subsidized
Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the
Ganges, as on the banks of th
e St. Lawrence, British arms were
triumphant. Well could the historian write: "Conquests equaling in
rapidity and far
 surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had
been achieved in the East." Well could the merchants of Lond
on declare
that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of
this world-wide conflict, commerce h
ad been "united with and made to
flourish by war."

From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the 
war
were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of
the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passe
d under the British flag. The
remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French
imperial ambit
ions on the American continent were laid to rest. In
exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war
, Spain
ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did
Macaulay write in after years that Pitt "
was the first Englishman of his
time; and he had made England the first country in the world."


THE EFFECTS OF WARFA
RE ON THE COLONIES

The various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as
they seem to-day, had a pr
ofound influence on colonial life and on the
destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular
assembli
es, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation
among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still coo
peration. The
American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
trades, were simply forced to raise 
and support armies, to learn the
arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of
statecraft. 
These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so
tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nat
ionalism.

=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with
the problems presented by the India
n and French menace that the
Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many
common ties among th
e settlers of New England, it required a deadly
fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,

composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The
colonies so united were bound together in "a fi
rm and perpetual league
of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and
succor, upon all just occ
asions." They made provision for distributing
the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
co
mmissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For
some twenty years the Confederation was active an
d it continued to hold
meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate
border.

Virginia, no
 less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of
intercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth 
century, the
Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the
colonies of New England. In 1684
 delegates from Virginia met at Albany
with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of
mutual de
fense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally
with the Carolinas in defending their borders against In
dian forays.

=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was
made in 1754. On the suggestion
 of the Lords of Trade in England, a
conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise
measures o
f defense against the French, and to enter into "articles of
union and confederation for the general defense of his M
ajesty's
subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of
war." New Hampshire, Massachusetts, C
onnecticut, Rhode Island, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a
plan of u
nion, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was
adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval
. The
colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the
scheme and the king disapproved it for the 
reason, Franklin said, that
it had "too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution."
Though the Albany un
ion failed, the document is still worthy of study
because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not s
olved
until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which
also Franklin was a member drafted the Con
stitution of the United
States.

[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]

=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The s
ame wars that showed
the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
of defending their inst
itutions. Particularly was this true of the last
French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine t
o
the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,
it is admitted, was far from satisfactory 
to the British government and
the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands
of Americans got
 a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the
field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lesso
ns that
were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen
could do under favorable circumstances a
nd they watched British regulars
operating on American soil. "This whole transaction," shrewdly remarked
Franklin of 
Braddock's campaign, "gave us Americans the first suspicion
that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular 
troops had not
been well founded." It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel
who drew his sword under the elm
 at Cambridge and took command of the
army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had "spurned the
whistle of bu
llets" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.

=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the prov
incials were
learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the
conflicts were costly in treasure a
s in blood. King Philip's war left
New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was
especiall
y expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by
the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of mon
ey. Paper
currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce
was driven from its usual channels an
d prices were enhanced. When the
end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy
liabilities, and to m
ake matters worse there was a fall of prices
accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
t
en years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, 
precipitating the quarrel
which led to American independence.

=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--T
he effects of the
defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to
estimate. Some British statesmen r
egarded it as a happy circumstance
that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no
foreign pow
er at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.
American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldie
rs of King Louis
were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country
to fear if they cast off Brit
ish sovereignty. At all events, France,
though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,
as eve
nts proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by
Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in 
the War of the
Revolution.


COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT

It was neither the Indian wars nor the F
rench wars that finally brought
forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife
with the mother c
ountry which culminated in union for the war of
independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in 
the
colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of
events in English domestic politics, and E
nglish measures of control
over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be
taken into account.


=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)
and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of 
the Puritan regime
(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had
little time to think of c
olonial policies or to interfere with colonial
affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by
inter
nal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
House of Commons, changed all that. In the reign 
of Charles II
(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade
by act of Parliament was develo
ped into a closely knit system and
powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same
time a syste
m of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which co
nferred so
much self-government on the Puritans.

Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of
 his
authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus
inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he 
could have kept his throne, he
would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
dominions a revo
lution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.
He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a 
more
efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He
made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, gov
ernor of all New England, New
York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last
days of his br
other's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of
Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited awa
y and
hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.

For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste
 of
ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not
accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles t
o land where, in his
opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the
Old South Church in Boston
; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to
a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middl
e
of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came
that King James had been dethroned by his angr
y subjects, and the people
of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to
dispose of Andros. 
The response was prompt and hearty. The hated
governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under
g
uard.

The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary
and by assured parliamentary supremacy, 
had an immediate effect in the
colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was
given another
 charter which, though not so liberal as the first,
restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. 
In the
other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of
affairs was resumed.

=The Indifference of t
he First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of
Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a
Han
overian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,
was more interested in Hanover than in England. 
George I and George II,
whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to
speak the English lan
guage, at least without an accent. The necessity of
taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that 
the
stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no
ground to complain of the exercise of pers
onal prerogatives by the king.
Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs
was in the hand
s of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed
his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his mott
o: "Let
sleeping dogs lie." He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
by exclaiming: "I will not be the minis
ter to enforce taxes at the
expense of blood." Such kings and such ministers were not likely to
arouse the slumbering
 resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
sea.

=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English rul
er from
James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters
personally, constant control over the colo
nies was exercised by royal
officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision
began in 1660, w
hen there was created by royal order a committee of the
king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week 
to consider
petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696
a regular board was established, 
known as the "Lords of Trade and
Plantations," which continued, until the American Revolution, to
scrutinize closely 
colonial business. The chief duties of the board were
to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures
 to those
assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the
colonies relative to their affairs.


The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by
American legislatures came before it for review as
 a matter of routine.
If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the
exercise of his veto power, k
nown as the royal disallowance. Any person
who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
cou
ld be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it
was the practice to hear at the same time the age
nt of the colony so
involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,
therefore, a formal affair, but
 was constantly employed on the
suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in
addition to the
 powers exercised by the governors in the royal
provinces.

=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative co
ntrol over the
colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The
king, by virtue of his inherent 
authority, claimed and exercised high
appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right
of appeal
 from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,
on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colo
ny. Any subject in
England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by
any act of a colonial legis
lature or any decision of a colonial court,
had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the
k
ing in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In
the exercise of appellate power, the king in co
uncil acting as a court
could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
enacted and approved, n
ull and void, on the ground that they were
contrary to English law.

=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day,
 week after week, year
after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over
colonial affairs was in oper
ation. At one time the British governors in
the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
duty
 on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North
Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council object
ed to it as
"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures
throughout the continent." At other ti
mes, Indian trade was regulated in
the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
legislature wer
e set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.

In short,
 foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when
 the
Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to
regulate interstate and foreign commerc
e and commerce with the Indians.
A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the
Supreme Court
 at Washington now towers above the states, kept the
colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established
 law. In
the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the
rulings and decisions upon them, wer
e written the real history of
British imperial control over the American colonies.

So great was the business before 
the Lords of Trade that the colonies
had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As
common griev
ances against the operation of this machinery of control
arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of 
men, with
the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
enterprise. Only a powerful blow w
as needed to weld these bodies into a
common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the
repeated
 minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came 
in the Revolution.

=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament
gained in power at the expe
nse of the king, it reached out to bring the
American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of
Charl
es I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense
body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade
, and manufactures of
America. All of it, based on the "mercantile" theory then prevalent in
all countries of Europe,
 was designed to control the overseas
plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
interests of
 the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had
got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonie
s of the
British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
raw materials, and forced to buy thei
r manufactured goods of England.

_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of
British colonial 
policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy-
-arms so
essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and
French. The beginning of this type of le
gislation was made in 1651 and
it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II
(1660-85).

The Navig
ation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
British ships. No trade could be carried on between Gr
eat Britain and
her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No
European goods could be brough
t to America save in the ships of the
country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were
almost f
atal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the
colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates
. The adverse
effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated
shipbuilding in the colonies, where the a
bundance of raw materials gave
the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother
country. Thus the
 colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
policy written into the Navigation Acts.

_The Acts against Manuf
actures._--The second group of laws was
deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
sharply 
with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may
be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exp
ortation of woolen
goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
colonies. When Parliament lear
ned, as the result of an inquiry, that New
England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending
larg
e numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,
and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring t
hat "no hats or felts,
dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be "put upon any vessel
or laden upon any horse
 or cart with intent to export to any place
whatever." The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
ru
inous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the 
colonies were
given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw
material; but at the same time the l
aw provided that "no mill or other
engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a
tilt hamme
r, and no furnace for making steel" should be built in the
colonies. As for those already built, they were declared p
ublic
nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of
the colonists, the woolen, hat, and ir
on industries, were laid under the
ban.

_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the
Bri
tish Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of
1663 required the colonies to export certain artic
les to Great Britain
or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to
the continent of Europe
 had to pass through a British port paying custom
duties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual
comm
ission. At first tobacco was the only one of the "enumerated
articles" which seriously concerned the American colonie
s, the rest
coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,
however, other commodities were added 
to the list of enumerated
articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,
hides, iron, lumber, 
and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies
were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English

ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
again.

_The Molasses Act._--Not content with la
ws enacted in the interest of
English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the
British West Indi
es against competition from their French and Dutch
neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative t
rade
with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar
and molasses could be obtained in large
 quantities at low prices. Acting
on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,
Parliament, in 17
33, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on
sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
coun
tries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the
French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. Th
e duties, however, were
not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
merrily, smuggling ta
king the place of lawful traffic.

=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly
of her colo
nial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the
policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furtherm
ore, the
restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
favorable to colonial prosperity. The Nav
igation Acts, for example,
redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers
of hemp, tar, lumber
, and ship stores in general. Favors in British
ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competito
rs
and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage
colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is m
uch justification in
the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
colonists gained more than 
they lost by British trade and industrial
legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when
free f
rom these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves
handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than fav
ored traders
and the recipients of bounties in English markets.

Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists fel
t little irritation
against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
enacted previous to the cl
ose of the French and Indian war. Relatively
few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
i
n farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America
to agriculture did not conflict with the inte
rests of the majority of
the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
and carried on in con
nection with their domestic duties, so that it was
not the sole support of any considerable number of people.

As a m
atter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those
relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes
 of tobacco were
boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
English government, to which d
uties should have been paid. Sugar and
molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New
England in s
pite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against
smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time di
d they succeed
in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of "the galling
restraints of trade" until aft
er the French war, when the British
government suddenly entered upon a new course.


SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD


In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,
in 1607, and the close of the French and Ind
ian war in 1763--a period of
a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent
to take its plac
e among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of
migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and

nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical
importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. 
Into the melting pot
were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands
of negroes were brought 
from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as
domestic servants in the North.

Why did they come? The reasons are v
arious. Some of them, the Pilgrims
and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and
Irish, and the
 Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments
that denied them the right to worship God according to the d
ictates of
their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
the Old World and to find free homes
 in America. Thousands, like the
negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of
adventure app
ealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
enterprising merchants.

How did they come? In some cases religi
ous brotherhoods banded together
and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other
cases great t
rading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it
was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or Willia
m Penn, who
undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their
own way across the sea. Others bou
nd themselves out for a term of years
in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account
of the
 profits derived from their sale as slaves.

Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get
acros
s the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down
forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They fou
nded churches,
schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and
wove. They fashioned ships and 
sailed the seas. They bartered and
traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
commerce--
Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the 
shore line
they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they
were already on the crest of the Al
leghanies.

Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,
the colonists were united in spirit
 by many common ties. The major
portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the
literature of Englan
d furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the
colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering
 a
wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
necessity. They had to unite in defense; fi
rst, against the Indians and
later against the French. They were all subjects of the same
sovereign--the king of Engl
and. The English Parliament made laws for
them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their
trade
, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common
grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.

Man
y of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
them into opposition to the British Crown and Par
liament. Most of them
were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled
it with their own hands.
 A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.
The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the
Chur
ch of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each
colony in time developed its own legislature electe
d by the voters; it
grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a
people learning self-relia
nce and self-government. The attempts to
strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of
coloni
es into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
which they were designed to quench.

Nevertheless, the
 Americans owed much of their prosperity to the
assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protecti
on
of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from
wiping out their settlements. Though their manu
facture and trade were
controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed
great advantages in her m
arkets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the
earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and
mer
chandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
which the colonists suffered through British reg
ulation of their
industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.
Still that is somewhat besi
de the point, for mere economic advantage is
not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A
thousan
d circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,
to inspire it with a passion for independence, and 
to prepare it for a
destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British
empire. The economists, who tri
ed to prove by logic unassailable that
America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the
spirit of
 Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George
Washington.

PART II. CONFLICT AND INDEPE
NDENCE




CHAPTER V

THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY


On October 25, 1760, King George II died and the Br
itish crown passed to
his young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover
and Sophia the granddau
ghter of James I, was a thorough German who never
even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigne
d.
The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English
with an accent and until his death prefer
red his German home. During
their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did
not govern but a
cted only through ministers representing the majority in
Parliament.


GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM

=The Character of t
he New King.=--The third George rudely broke the
German tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he w
as a
foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.
To the draft of his first speech to Par
liament, he added the popular
phrase: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
Briton." Macaulay, t
he English historian, certainly of no liking for
high royal prerogative, said of George: "The young king was a born
E
nglishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No
portion of his subjects had anything to reproach
 him with.... His age,
his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated
public favor. He was in th
e bloom of youth; his person and address were
pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without
gl
aring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues."

Nevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his t
utors, and
his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty
notions about the sacredness of royal au
thority and his duty to check
the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His
mother had dinne
d into his ears the slogan: "George, be king!" Lord
Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor requir
ed him
to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
laws. Thus educated, he surrounded hi
mself with courtiers who encouraged
him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all
parties, and to 
place himself at the head of the nation and empire.

GEORGE III]

=Political Par
ties and George III.=--The state of the political parties
favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancien
t luster of
the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller
freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of town
s, and Protestant
non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long
continuance in power and had as a c
onsequence raised up many enemies in
their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up
all hope
 of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they
still cherished their old notions about divine right. Wi
th the
accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
around the throne again. George received
 his Tory friends with open
arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.

=The British Par
liamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British
Parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his
 allies
with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first
place, the House of Lords was composed
 mainly of hereditary nobles whose
number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as
of old. Tho
ugh the members of the House of Commons were elected by
popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English peop
le. Great
towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no
representatives at all. While there were 
about eight million inhabitants
in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is
to say, only 
about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the C
ommons
although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny bo
roughs were often controlled by
lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.
The "rotten-
boroughs," as they were called by reformers, were a public
scandal, but George III readily made use of them to get hi
s friends into
the House of Commons.


GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES

=Grenville and the War Deb
t.=--Within a year after the accession of
George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him
wi
th "gross incivility" and the crowds shouting "Pitt forever!" The
direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying 
the king's
confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,
a grave and laborious man who for
 years had groaned over the increasing
cost of government.

The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was 
the adjustment
of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest
point in the history of the c
ountry. More revenue was absolutely
necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention
finally to 
the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a
zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in p
ublic
service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
governors in America. These two men, with t
he support of the entire
ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, "a new system of colonial
government. It was announ
ced by authority that there were to be no more
requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, bu
t
that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.
Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by t
he Crown; they were to
be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the
expenses of this force were t
o be met by parliamentary taxation."

=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed
before th
e board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new min
istry provided a
remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws
authorizing paper money or extendin
g the life of outstanding bills. This
law was aimed at the "cheap money" which the Americans were fond of
making when
 specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their
English creditors in return for goods and in payment of 
the interest and
principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long
battle over sound money on this c
ontinent.

=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)
George III issued a royal proclamation 
providing, among other things,
for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
Paris from the 
French. One of the provisions in this royal decree
touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's

officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at re
strictions on
settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and
"squatting" on land purchased from th
e Indians or simply seized without
authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases
from the 
Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
and dispose of them for settlement. A second provisio
n in the same
proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,
including the lucrative fur business
, in the hands of royal officers in
the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise
were decla
red to be in the interest of the crown and for the
preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses
.

=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their
attention to measures of taxation and trade. S
ince the heavy debt under
which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
America, nothing see
med more reasonable to them than the proposition
that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavi
ly
upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this
reasoning. There was no doubt about the pu
rpose of this law, for it was
set forth clearly in the title: "An act for granting certain duties in
the British colo
nies and plantations in America ... for applying the
produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of def
ending,
protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for
more effectually preventing the clandes
tine conveyance of goods to and
from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
trade between t
he same and Great Britain." The old Molasses Act had been
prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as 
a revenue
measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,
and many other commodities imported 
into the colonies. The enforcement
of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had
"teeth in i
t." Special precautions as to bonds, security, and
registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, prom
ised
a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.

The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrat
ive
measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
vessels stationed along the American coast wer
e authorized to stop,
search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial
ports. By supplementary or
ders, the entire British official force in
America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
na
vigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
royal governors were curtly ordered to the fron
t to do their full duty
in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge
of official obligati
ons were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for
naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by

large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.

=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination move
d
steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration
in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan fo
r a stamp bill. The next
year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded
its authors. The vote
 in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;
while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the form
ality
of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received
royal assent by a commission acting as a
 board of regency. Protests of
colonial agents in London were futile. "We might as well have hindered
the sun's progr
ess!" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in
the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its 
course and
from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid
interest in the city of London. In f
act, it is recorded that the fateful
measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
act for 
the king when he was incapacitated.

The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British
governmen
t to raise revenue in America "towards defraying the expenses
of defending, protecting, and securing the British colo
nies and
plantations in America." It was a long measure of more than fifty
sections, carefully planned and skillfully
 drawn. By its provisions
duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
transactions,--deeds, mortgages
, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on
licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing
cards, d
ice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and
advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anyt
hing
escaped.

=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp
Act would rouse opposition in Am
erica--how great they could not
conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General
Wolfe, Colonel B
arre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous
warning in the Commons. "Believe me--remember I this day told you s
o--"
he exclaimed, "the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
first will accompany them still ... a pe
ople jealous of their liberties
and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated." The
answer of the mini
stry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.
Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of

soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quarterin
g Act ordering the
colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
the new laws. "We have th
e power to tax them," said one of the ministry,
"and we will tax them."


COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL

=Popular
 Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an
outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cit
ies took the
lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to
import British goods while the hate
d law stood upon the books. Lawyers,
some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
intimida
ted by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Wh
igs, who had
long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested
against taxation without their consent
, as the Whigs had done in old
England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many
of them of th
e official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
Whig aristocrats as "seditious, factious and republican."
 Yet the
opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering
Act, grew steadily all through the 
summer of 1765.

In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
countryside. All through the North an
d in some of the Southern colonies,
there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to
resist the S
tamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were
known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the forme
r including
artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both
groups were alike in that they h
ad as yet taken little part in public
affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the
right 
to vote for colonial assemblymen.

While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
drafting 
well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of
Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measure
s. They stirred
up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts
were made to sell the stamps
. They sacked and burned the residences of
high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by
threa
ts and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use
of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty c
arried their operations
to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
frightened and drew back in a
stonishment at the forces they had
unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very
effective r
esistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
domestic industries, their own particular province being the 
manufacture
of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to
feed and clothe their families with
out buying British goods.

=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial
assemblies, accustome
d to battle against British policies, supported the
popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On M
ay 30,
the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
that the General Assembly of the colony 
alone had the right to lay taxes
upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
"illegal, uncon
stitutional, and unjust." It was in support of these
resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: "
Caesar
had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III...." Cries of
"Treason" were calmly met by the orator w
ho finished: "George III may
profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it."

[Illustration: PATRI
CK HENRY]

=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call
of Virginia by inviting the coloni
es to elect delegates to a Congress to
be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded
and sent
 representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest
affection for the king's person and government, firmly 
spread on record
a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They
declared that taxes could not be im
posed without their consent, given
through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed
a tendency
 to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade
acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right t
o petition the
king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made "humble
supplication" for the repeal of th
e Stamp Act.

The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked
the rise of a new agency of gove
rnment to express the will of America.
It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
government 
of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress
of the United States under the Constitution. It was a suc
cessful attempt
at union. "There ought to be no New England men," declared Christopher
Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Cong
ress, "no New Yorkers known on the
Continent, but all of us Americans."

=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar A
ct.=--The effect of American
resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies
had been effect
ively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging
at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants
 in London,
Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England
were thrown out of employment. T
he government had sown folly and was
reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.

Perplexed by the storm the
y had raised, the ministers summoned to the
bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for
Pennsylvani
a, who was in London. "Do you think it right," asked
Grenville, "that America should be protected by this country and
 pay no
part of the expenses?" The answer was brief: "That is not the case; the
colonies raised, clothed, and paid du
ring the last war twenty-five
thousand men and spent many millions." Then came an inquiry whether the
colonists would
 accept a modified stamp act. "No, never," replied
Franklin, "never! They will never submit to it!" It was next sugge
sted
that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready
answer. "They cannot force a man to take
 stamps.... They may not find a
rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."

The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the
 House of Commons a few days
later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts
due British merch
ants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,
workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of 
the
colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close
of his career, the latter just beginning hi
s, argued cogently in favor
of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.
"America must learn," he
 wailed, "that prayers are not to be brought to
Caesar through riot and sedition." His protests were idle. The Common
s
agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
victorious majority. It was carried through the L
ords in the face of
strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now
restored to his right min
d.

In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of
the Americans that it was without power t
o tax them. On the contrary, it
accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the
colonies were su
bordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;
that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authorit
y to make
laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the
resolutions and proceedings of the colonist
s denying such authority were
null and void.

The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
demonstratio
ns. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and
trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a me
re paper
resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
the name of King George. Their confide
nce was soon strengthened by the
news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically
restoring the condi
tion of affairs before Grenville and Townshend
inaugurated their policy of "thoroughness."


RESUMPTION OF BRITISH RE
VENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES

=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.
Though Pitt, the
 friend of America, was once more prime minister, and
seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe
 illness
gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.
Unconvinced by the experience with t
he Stamp Act, Townshend brought
forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,
which to this da
y are associated with his name. First among his
restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcem
ent
of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
in the hands of British commissioners app
ointed by the king, resident in
the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all
control by the c
olonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a
tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles impo
rted into
the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
the payment of the salaries and othe
r expenses of royal colonial
officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the
tea trade which
 the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This
law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to 
pay in
England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea
merchants might thus find it possible 
to undersell American tea
smugglers.

=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been
content wit
h laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,
and neglected their collection, perhaps little would hav
e been heard of
the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the
harsh, enforcement of the law. It 
ordered customs officers to remain at
their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,
1767, i
t expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
issue "writs of assistance," empowering customs officer
s to enter "any
house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies
or plantations in America to s
earch for and seize" prohibited or
smuggled goods.

The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued
 to
revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who
cherished the spirit of personal independence and
 who had made actual
gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a "minion of the law"
to enter a man's house an
d search his papers and premises, was too much
for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for
self
-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to
establish them, and who wanted to trade without official
 interference.

The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
illicit trade with Canada an
d had aroused a violent hostility at that
time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
arose 
in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
Massachusetts court for writs of assistance "as usual." 
This application
was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a
speech of such fire and eloq
uence that it sent every man who heard it
away "ready to take up arms against writs of assistance." Otis denounced
th
e practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
his head and another his throne, a tyrant's devi
ce which placed the
liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work
possible malice on any innoc
ent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to
spread terror and desolation through the land. "What a scene," he
exclaim
ed, "does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's
 house, may get a
writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary
exertion will provoke anoth
er until society is involved in tumult and
blood." He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament
c
ould not establish it because it was against the British constitution.
This was an assertion resting on slender found
ation, but it was quickly
echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to
America to resist the e
xercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.
"Then and there," wrote John Adams, "the child Independence was born."

Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of
customs officers in his grim determination t
o enforce the law.

=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's
Acts were signed by the ki
ng, Parliament took a still more drastic step.
The assembly of New York, protesting against the "ruinous and
insuppor
table" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the
care of British troops in accordance with the terms of 
the Quartering
Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
obey the law. It was not until a
 third election was held that compliance
with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the
meanti
me, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
representative bodies rested.


RENEWED RESISTANCE I
N AMERICA

=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the
leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to res
ist the policy of renewed
intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a
Circular Letter addressed
 to the assemblies of the other colonies
informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly
condemni
ng the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that
Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans wit
hout their consent
and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be
represented in Parliament. It we
nt on shrewdly to submit to
consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
who were subject
ed to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other co
lonies,
in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common
predicament in which they were all placed.

[Il
lustration: _From an old print._

SAMUEL ADAMS]

=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hea
ring
of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On
meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it
. The Maryland, Georgia, and
South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also
dissolved at once. 
The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole righ
t of
imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew
the right of petition to the crown, con
demning the transportation of
persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the
king for a redre
ss of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution
of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the 
royal
governor.

=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities
kept steadily rising as assem
blies were dissolved, the houses of
citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
the centers
 of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British
goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and 
women set about
the patronage of home products still more loyally.

On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the str
eets of Boston began to
jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things
went from bad to worse u
ntil some "boys and young fellows" began to
throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the

crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the
"massacre," a mass meeting was held in the town
 and Samuel Adams was
sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated
and tried to compromise. 
Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded
and ordered the regulars away.

The Boston Massacre stirred the countr
y from New Hampshire to Georgia.
Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.
Their defen
se was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by
John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought eve
n the worst

offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the
jury, however, Adams warned the Bri
tish government against its course,
saying, that "from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
town wil
l always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one." Two of
the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.

=R
esistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some
citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the condu
ct of the royal governor,
openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven
who were taken prison
ers were hanged as traitors. A little later royal
troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance Rive
r,
called the "Lexington of the South."

=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as
well 
as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists
broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narraga
nsett Bay looking for
smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was
caught fast. During the
 night several men from Providence boarded the
vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission
,
sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to
account, failed because it could not find a single
 informer. The very
appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to
action; and in March, 1773, 
the House of Burgesses passed a resolution
creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
amo
ng the colonies in resistance to British measures.

=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding
 the
Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except
that on tea, it in no way relaxed its re
solve to enforce the other
commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,
Parliament decided to rel
ieve the British East India Company of the
financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
Te
a Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to
return to the Company the regular import duties, l
evied in England, on
all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be
collected in America, was 
left as a reminder of the principle laid down
in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the
colonis
ts.

This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the
colonists for several reasons. It was an act o
f favoritism for one
thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it
promised to dump on the Americ
an market, suddenly, an immense amount of
cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large
sto
cks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who
were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. 
It carried with it an
irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New
York, and Boston, capta
ins of ships who brought tea under this act were
roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citiz
ens,
disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
into the harbor. This was serious busines
s, for it was open, flagrant,
determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed
it.


RETALIATIO
N BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT

=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in
Boston confirmed K
ing George in his conviction that there should be no
soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. "The die is c
ast," he
stated with evident satisfaction. "The colonies must either triumph or
submit.... If we take the resolute pa
rt, they will undoubtedly be very
meek." Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as "the
proceedings of a tum
ultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had
the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not

trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not
understand." This expressed, in concise form, exac
tly the sentiments of
Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.
Even Pitt, Lord Chatha
m, was prepared to support the government in
upholding its authority.

=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, begi
nning on March 31, 1774,
passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five
"intolerable acts." Th
ey were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The
_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston 
to
commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,
revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and pr
ovided furthermore that
the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should
be named by the royal 
governor, and that town meetings (except to elect
certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent.
 A
_third_ measure, after denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful
government" in the provinces, authorized roy
al agents to transfer to
Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
persons accused of murder
 in connection with the enforcement of the law.
The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts

towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted
religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada,
 extended the boundaries
of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western
region, government b
y a viceroy.

The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary
celerity. There was an opposition, aler
t and informed; but it was
ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,
condemning it roundly fo
r punishing the innocent with the guilty, and
showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He

was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both
houses without a division, the entry "unanim
ous" being made upon their
journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.
The law destroying
 the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a
vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote o
f four to
one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. "What passed in Boston,"
exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Ma
nsfield, "is the overt act of High
Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight." The
crown and Parl
iament were united in resorting to punitive measures.

In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To 
the
American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That
project they viewed not as an act of grace or o
f mercy but as a direct
attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The
British government did n
ot grant religious toleration to Catholics
either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive
in
 granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under
 their charters,
large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.

To enforce these intolerable acts the militar
y arm of the British
government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed
forces in America, General
 Gage, was appointed governor of
Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King
George was 
to give "the rebels," as he called them, a taste of strong
medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by f
orce.


FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA

=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the
d
estruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
a new phase in the struggle. In the early days
 of the contest with the
British ministry, the Americans spoke of their "rights as Englishmen"
and condemned the acts
 of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the
principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When

they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned
for support to their "natural rights." The latt
er doctrine, in the form
in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the
constitutional argument. Jo
hn Locke had used it with good effect in
defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American
leade
rs, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in
the hour of their distress. They openly declared 
that their rights did
not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the
crown. "Old Magna Carta 
was not the beginning of all things," retorted
Otis when the constitutional argument failed. "A time may come when
Pa
rliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,
inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonist
s as men and as citizens
would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
until the general confla
gration." Of the same opinion was the young and
impetuous Alexander Hamilton. "The sacred rights of mankind," he
excl
aimed, "are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the w
hole volume of human
destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or
obscured by mortal power."

F
irm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their
rights, there is every reason for believing th
at in the beginning they
hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly
avowed that they were
 loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
language against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalis
ts as a
firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
concessions from England. "I argue this caus
e with the greater
pleasure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
assistance, "as it is in favor of 
British liberty ... and as it is in
opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods
cost one k
ing of England his head and another his throne."

=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of

American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,
Edmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to 
restrain the rise of
American democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He
saw how fixed and rooted 
in the nature of things was the American
spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that
ther
e were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only
three. One was to remove the cause of friction by chan
ging the spirit of
the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
in the essential circumstan
ces of American life. The second was to
prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his
countrymen to 
beware lest the colonists declare that "a government
against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason i
s a
government to which submission is equivalent to slavery." The third and
right way to meet the problem, Burke conc
luded, was to accept the
American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies
into equal partners
hip.

=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,
was equally impossible to George III a
nd the majority in Parliament. To
their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American
resistance unlaw
ful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their
view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the "rebels"; and
 that very
act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:
"Facts are stubborn things." Opinions 
were unseen, but marching soldiers
were visible to the veriest street urchin. "Now," said Gouverneur
Morris, "the she
ep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
It was too late to talk about the excellence of the British

constitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
historians as to why the crisis came at last, h
e can clarify his
understanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately oration, _On
Conciliation with America_.

CHAPTER VI

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION


RESISTANCE AND RETALIATION

=The Continental Congress.=--Whe
n the news of the "intolerable acts"
reached America, every one knew what strong medicine Parliament was
prepared to 
administer to all those who resisted its authority. The
cause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. 
Opposition
to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national
character. To local committees and
 provincial conventions was added a
Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,
1774, at 
the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons
was electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates
 were elected
during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in
Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. 
Many of the greatest men in America
were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John
and Samuel
 Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was
represented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majorit
y favored
moderation.

The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in
clear and dignified langua
ge the grievances of the colonists. It
approved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and
promi
sed the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to
King George and another to the people of England, d
isavowing the idea of
independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British
government.

=The Non-Imp
ortation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,
with professions of faith and with petitions. It took on
e revolutionary
step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,
and the enforcement of this ag
reement it placed in the hands of local
"committees of safety and inspection," to be elected by the qualified
voters.
 The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw
itself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind Americ
an citizens and
to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within
the British state and laid d
own a test of allegiance to the new order.
The colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose
one 
authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the
non-importation agreement or they were against it. They 
either bought
English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--"May Britain
be wise and America be free"--t
he first Continental Congress adjourned
in October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting
of a 
second Congress, should necessity require.

=Lord North's "Olive Branch."=--When the news of the action of the
Americ
an Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal
of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could 
wring from the prime
minister, Lord North, was a set of "conciliatory resolutions" proposing
to relieve from taxation
 any colony that would assume its share of
imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
t
he crown. This "olive branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
the king of support at all hazards in suppress
ing the rebellion and by
the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the
commerce of New England
.

=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the
British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed
 none of their efforts in
upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military
stores had been collecte
d at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize
them. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid
.
At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred "the little thing" that
produced "the great event." An unexpected co
llision beyond the thought
or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
battle field.

=Th
e Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war
was actually at hand, the second Continental Cong
ress, which met at
Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was
beyond human power. It peti
tioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil

war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to
Lord North's offer of conciliation, stating that
 the proposal was
unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
the offensive acts of Parliam
ent.

=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America
were about to present the last petition of
 Congress to the king on
August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This
announcement declared t
hat the colonists, "misled by dangerous and
ill-designing men," were in a state of insurrection; it called on the
civ
il and military powers to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
threatened with "condign punishment the authors, pe
rpetrators, and
abettors of such traitorous designs." It closed with the usual prayer:
"God, save the king." Later in
 the year, Parliament passed a sweeping
act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was
silent at
 last. Force was also America's answer.


AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE

=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not 
given up all hope of
reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved
to defend American right
s by arms if necessary. It transformed the
militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,
i
nto a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.
It assumed the powers of a government and prepa
red to raise money, wage
war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.

[Illustration: _From an old 
print_

SPIRIT OF 1776]

Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by
the stubborn defense of
 Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British
regulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took comm
and
of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments
in drumming up recruits for its army in 
England, Scotland, and Ireland,
the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of
Hesse-Cassel in Germa
ny contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands
of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insu
lt to
America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
of the water. Such was, long afterward,
 the judgment of the conservative
historian Lecky: "The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to
subdue the
 essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made
reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable." The ne
ws of this
wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America
before there ran all down the coast the
 thrilling story that Washington
had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with
his entire ar
my for Halifax.

=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were
bearing the Americans away f
rom their old position under the British
constitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their
desires, pr
udent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united
them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all
 thought of
revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In
all parts of the country and amon
g all classes, the question of the hour
was being debated. "American independence," as the historian Bancroft
says, "
was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
assembly. It had been discussed in every part of the 
country by farmers
and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the
coast and the backwoodsmen of
 the West; in town meetings and from the
pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county
convention
s and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and
assemblies."

[Illustration: _From an old print_

THOMAS 
PAINE]

=Paine's "Commonsense."=--In the midst of this ferment of American
opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer b
roke in upon the hesitating
public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and
without apologies. In 
the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the
first of his famous tracts, "Commonsense," a passionate attack upon t
he
British monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.
Casting aside the language of petition with 
which Americans had hitherto
addressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
with many a viole
nt epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system
which had laid the world "in blood and ashes." Instead of praisi
ng the
British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, 
protesting that it was "owing
to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the
government, that the 
Crown is not as oppressive in England as in
Turkey."

Having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to t
he old
order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
separation from Great Britain. There was noth
ing in the sphere of
practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the
mother country. Allegianc
e to her had been responsible for the many wars
in which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weigh
ty
in behalf of independence. "Our corn will fetch its price in any market
in Europe and our imported goods must be p
aid for, buy them where we
will." As to matters of government, "it is not in the power of Britain
to do this continen
t justice; the business of it will soon be too
weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
conve
nience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us."

There is accordingly no alternative to independenc
e for America.
"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of
the slain, the weeping voice 
of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...
Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the
choice of
 the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The
sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not
 the affair of a
city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not
the concern of a day, a yea
r or an age; posterity is involved in the
contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
proceed
ings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and
honor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppos
e not only the
tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be
extinct. Let none other be hear
d among us than those of a good citizen,
an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
manki
nd and of the free and independent states of America." As more than
100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the 
country, patriots
exclaimed with Washington: "Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!"

=The Drift of Events toward I
ndependence.=--Official support for the
idea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of
Februa
ry, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,
advocated a new constitution for the colony and ab
solute independence
for all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way
by abolishing the system o
f royal administration and establishing a
complete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the
neighbori
ng state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
others shrank. It empowered its representatives in th
e Congress to
concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts,
 and Virginia quickly
responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May
15, instructed its deleg
ates at Philadelphia to propose the independence
of the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act
 of
separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the
state house was lowered for all time.

Meanwh
ile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events
outside. The subject of independence was constantly be
ing raised. "Are
we rebels?" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.
"No: we must declare ourselves 
a free people." Others hesitated and
spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. "Is
not Ameri
ca already independent?" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.
"Why not then declare it?" Still there was uncertainty
 and delegates
avoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,
Congress declared that the auth
ority of the British crown in America
must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
their own.

THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE TO THE CO
MMITTEE OF CONGRESS]

=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,
on June 7, the Virginia 
delegation in the Congress moved that "these
united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
states
." A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on Jul
y 2 all the
states save New York went on record in favor of severing their political
connection with Great Britain. T
wo days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft
of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,
was 
adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang
out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried t
he news to the uttermost
hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among
the powers of the wor
ld.

To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence
is one of them. American patriotism is f
orever associated with it; but
patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of
its language or 
the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
the records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the
 simple fact
that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
ideal which for three centuries 
has been taking form and spreading
throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down
thrones and a
ristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
battle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Th
ierry. That
ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple
sentence: "Governments derive their jus
t powers from the consent of the
governed."

Written in a "decent respect for the opinions of mankind," to set forth

the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from
Britain, the Declaration contained a long list of "
abuses and
usurpations" which had induced them to throw off the government of King
George. That section of the Declar
ation has passed into "ancient"
history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for
government and
 giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
household phrase in the Old World as in the New.

In the mo
re enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,
from the standpoint of the old system of government, wer
e the essence of
revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable 
rights including life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these
rights
; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed; (4) whenever any form of government beco
mes destructive of
these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
institute new government, layi
ng its foundations on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
eff
ect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic
drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of
 government and every
privilege not founded on popular assent.


THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIAN
CE

=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into
armed resistance, the patriots found it ne
cessary to consolidate their
forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for
the means were at 
hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and
committees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution
 were
in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial
groups of patriots formed to exchange views 
and create public sentiment.
As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston
under the leader
ship of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent
emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of ed
ucation
in the doctrines of liberty.

[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE
DECLARATION OF 
INDEPENDENCE]

Upon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee
were built county committees and
 then the larger colonial committees,
congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the
revolutionary 
elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympat
hizers and
controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was
built the Continental Congress, the pr
ecursor of union under the
Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the
United States. This
 was the revolutionary government set up within the
British empire in America.

=State Constitutions Framed.=--With t
he rise of these new assemblies of
the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal
provinces the 
governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,
and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities.
 The appeal to
the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
themselves, issued by the Congress in
 May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.
Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Ma
ryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions
as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. 
Connecticut and
Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
needs, merely renounced their a
llegiance to the king and went on as
before so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,
which had
 drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
complete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massac
husetts with much
deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its
essential features remains un
changed to-day.

The new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
models. For the royal governor
 was substituted a governor or president
chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and
Massac
husetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was
substituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lo
wer house, or
assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property
restriction on the suffrage, though 
lowered slightly in some states, was
continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
deprived o
f the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several
constitutions, for governors, senators, and representa
tives, indicated
that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
experiments in democracy. The prote
sts of a few women, like Mrs. John
Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a
government whi
ch excluded them from political rights were treated as
mild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey wo
men were
allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.

By the new state constitutions the signs and symbo
ls of royal power, of
authority derived from any source save "the people," were swept aside
and republican government
s on an imposing scale presented for the first
time to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepare
d
by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in
Europe. There they were destined to serve as
 a guide and inspiration to
a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the
democratic revoluti
on in the Old World.

=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions
was an easy task for the
 revolutionary leaders. They had only to build
on foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of

government was another matter. There had always been, it must be
remembered, a system of central control over the co
lonies, but Americans
had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the
crown of Great Britain 
was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,
accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for
acti
on on a national stage.

Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of
national destiny. There
 were differences in economic interest--commerce
and industry in the North and the planting system of the South. Ther
e
were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
for common defense. To these practical diffi
culties were added local
pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
provincial dignity, and t
he scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
the common enterprise.

Nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consid
er some sort of
federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work
before the most sagacious lead
ers began to urge the desirability of a
permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go
into a 
committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,
undaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty ye
ars before, again
presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed
and it was not until late 
in 1777 that Congress presented to the states
the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed
ratificati
on, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the
surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the la
st of the
states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all
that could be wrung from the reluctant
 states, provided for neither a
chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a
Congress of deleg
ates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews 
of
government--money and soldiers.

=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were
taken in 
the direction of independent government, the patriots devised
and applied tests designed to discover who were for and
 who were against
the new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental
Congress agreed not to allow th
e importation of British goods, it
provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such
agencies 
were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all
opponents being excluded from the elections. Before th
ese bodies those
who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or
punished according to circumstance
s. As soon as the new state
constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the
same way to ferre
t out all who were not outspoken in their support of
the new order of things.

[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]

Th
ese patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,
were sometimes ruthless in their methods. They c
alled upon all men to
sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "association test."
Those who refused were pr
omptly branded as outlaws, while some of the
more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at

one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New
York. Thousands were black-listed and subjected 
to espionage. The
black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
persons of prominence who wer
e under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who
were bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were
suppressed
 and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in
the North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated
 and the
proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.

The work of the official agencies for suppression of oppos
ition was
sometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without
trial, and others were tarred and 
feathered. One was placed upon a cake
of ice and held there "until his loyalty to King George might cool."
Whole fami
lies were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
they could within the British lines or into Canada, whe
re the British
government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,
but they were defended on the g
round that in effect a civil war, as well
as a war for independence, was being waged.

=The Patriots and Tories.=--Th
us, by one process or another, those who
were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
prefer
red to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the
Americans favored independence and what share remained
 loyal to the
British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution
was not submitted to popular vo
te, and on the point of numbers we have
conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a
carefu
l and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds
of the people were for the American cause and not m
ore than one-third
opposed the Revolution at all stages.

On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularl
y known,
extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of
the first Continental Congress and h
ad fled to England when he saw its
temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not
one-fifth of t
he American people supported the insurrection and that
"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with 
Great
Britain upon constitutional principles to independence." At the same
time General Robertson, who had lived in A
merica twenty-four years,
declared that "more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the
king's government to the
 Congress' tyranny." In an address to the king
in that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that "the numb
er
of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
enlisted by Congress to oppose them."

=The Chara
cter of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,
more than a thousand people fled with him. This great co
mpany, according
to a careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the province by
virtue of their official rank; of
 their dignified callings and
professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture." The act
of banishment pa
ssed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,
"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest fam
ilies of
New England," more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard
College. The same was true of New York an
d Philadelphia; namely, that
the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,
clergymen and wealthy m
erchants. With passion the loyalists fought
against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
for
 a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.

=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in Am
erica joined
the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
cause. Those who were skillful with t
he pen assailed the patriots in
editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared
that the members
 of Congress were "obscure, pettifogging attorneys,
bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc." The people and th
eir
leaders they characterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
dregs of mankind." The generals in the army t
hey sneered at as "men of
rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress."

=Patriot Writers Arouse the Na
tional Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,
patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
opinion
 favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat
the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the
 early days of the
war. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the
winter of 1775 as they attem
pted to bring Canada into the revolution--a
disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in
1
776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and
beaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. Th
ese reverses were almost
too great for the stoutest patriots.

Pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however,
 to meet the needs
of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,
forsook the classroom for the
 field of political controversy. The poet,
Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated
the
 spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,
and satires flowed from the press in an unending s
tream. Fast days,
battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress
afforded to patriotic clerg
ymen abundant opportunities for sermons.
"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?" anxiously inquired John
Adams i
n a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. "The clergy of
every denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, t
hunder and lighten
every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God
most explicitly and ferventl
y for our remarkable successes. They pray
for the American army."

Thomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been w
ith the forces of
Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New
Jersey into Pennsylvania. He
 knew the effect of such reverses on the
army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great
app
eal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, "The Crisis," the first part
of which he had written while defeat and gloom we
re all about him. This
tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. "These are the
times that try men's s
ouls," he opened. "The summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
c
ountry; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
and women." Paine laid his lash fiercely on the
 Tories, branding every
one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, self-interested fear." He
deplored the inadequ
acy of the militia and called for a real army. He
refuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disast
er
and he promised victory soon. "By perseverance and fortitude," he
concluded, "we have the prospect of a glorious i
ssue; by cowardice and
submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a
depopulated city, habita
tions without safety and slavery without
hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it." His ringing call to
arms wa
s followed by another and another until the long contest was
over.


MILITARY AFFAIRS

=The Two Phases of the War.=--
The war which opened with the battle of
Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of
Cornwallis at 
Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct
phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with
 France, in
1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first
phase, the war was confined mainly t
o the North. The outstanding
features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,
the expulsion of A
merican forces from New York and their retreat through
New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia
 by the
British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his
capture at Saratoga in October, 1777,
 and the encampment of American
forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.

The final phase of the wa
r, opening with the treaty of alliance with
France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,
the
 West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events
were the withdrawal of the British from Philadel
phia, the battle of
Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying
American forces from Morristo
wn, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the
West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois
country, se
cured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
country between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South,
 the second
period opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,
conquered Georgia, and restored the
 royal governor. In 1780 they seized
Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under
Gates at
 Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at
Cowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing sc
enes. Cornwallis
began the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into
North Carolina, clashed with hi
m at Guilford Court House, retired to the
coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and
fo
rtified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the
sea and the combined French and American forces
 on land.

=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of
the war offered many problems. From
 first to last it extended from
Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was
nearly three 
thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though
the British navy kept the channel open, transports were con
stantly
falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The
sea, on the other hand, offered an easy
 means of transportation between
points along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of
wealth and p
opulation. Of this the British made good use. Though early
forced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it
 until the end
of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
the approach of the French flee
t; and they captured and held both
Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest
of cities.


Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small
portion of the American people lived in towns
. Countrymen back from the
coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on
the produce of th
e soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact
gave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British vent
ured far
from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced
to surrender at Saratoga because he 
was surrounded and cut off from his
base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they
were hara
ssed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,
and Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene
 at Guilford far
in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.
Sustained by their own labo
r, possessing the interior to which their
armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the
Am
ericans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
blow.

=The Sea Power.=--The British made good u
se of their fleet in cutting
off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
United States. A
s an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was
not such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable 
though
somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a
nation fighting for existence, if silks,
 fine linens, and chinaware were
cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.

Nor did the brilliant 
exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry
materially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of Am
erican
seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of
British marine insurance, but they did not 
dethrone the mistress of the
seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the
hundreds of privatee
rs and minor captains who overhauled British supply
ships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until
 the
French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to
reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea
 and make plans based upon the
possibilities of a maritime disaster.

=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of militar
y leadership it is
difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.
There is no doubt that al
l the British commanders were men of experience
in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during 
the
French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict
disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless
 he loved ease,
society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to
overwhelm Washington by salli
es from his comfortable bases at New York
and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John
Bu
rgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from
Canada, had likewise seen service in the French War b
oth in America and
Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
after the collapse of his pla
ns and the surrender of his army in 1777,
he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who
dire
cted the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,
had "learned his trade on the continent," and was
 regarded as a man of
discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose
achievements at Camden
 and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubt
ed
talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
India. Though none of them, perhaps, were men
 of first-rate ability,
they all had training and experience to guide them.

[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]

The A
mericans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been
interested in military strategy and had tested his coolne
ss under fire
during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He
had no doubts about the justice
 of his cause, such as plagued some of
the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He
was res
erved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or
depression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolutio
n, "what held
the patriot forces together?" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John
Marshall_. Then he answers: "George W
ashington and he alone. Had he
died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....
Washington was th
e soul of the American cause. Washington was the
government. Washington was the Revolution." The weakness of Congress
 in
furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at
ease while the army starved, the intrigues 
of army officers against him
such as the "Conway cabal," the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the
treason of Benedi
ct Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his
breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen,
 did
not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
to the bitter end. The weight of Washin
gton's moral force was
immeasurable.

Of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have
been expe
rienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the
unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a dr
uggist, book
seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called
him to battle. Horatio Gates was l
ooked upon as a "seasoned soldier"
because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at
Braddock's
 memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven
Years' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of
 the Revolution.
The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing
defeat at Camden put an end to
 his military pretensions. Nathanael
Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience
who, when
 convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and
took up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and mode
st planter of South
Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
with the Indians ten or 
twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the
heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had s
een
some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military
knowledge, from the point of view of a trained B
ritish officer, was
negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New
Hampshire, and a major in the lo
cal militia when duty summoned him to
lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a
Pennsylvania far
mer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,
read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered hims
elf for
service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and
it is typical of them all. Some had se
en fighting with the French and
Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
troops comma
nded according to the strategy evolved in European
experience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowle
dge of
the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought
during the Revolution all those qualitie
s counted heavily in the
balance.

=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added
military talen
t from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in
the iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussi
a, joined
Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
men, laughing and cursing as he t
urned raw countrymen into regular
soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from
Poland came 
Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war
as waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as t
eaching.
Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by
several officers of wide experience, and
 remained loyally throughout the
war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the
siege of Savann
ah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American
war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. 
To these
distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American
revolutionary fortunes, was due much o
f that spirit and discipline which
fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
power of 
the first rank.

=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their
annals are short and simple. Th
e regulars from the standing army who
were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up
by specia
l efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought
outright by King George presented few problems of management 
to the
British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and
enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them w
ere well disciplined and many
of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George
fought bravely, as t
he records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth
demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that mat
ter,
some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
their own kin; but they obeyed orders.

The
 Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim
determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacki
ng in
discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke
in upon them, there were no common prepa
rations for it. There was no
continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of
them experienced in
 fighting but few of them "regulars" in the military
sense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,
u
naccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints
imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They
 were continually
leaving the service just at the most critical moments. "The militia,"
lamented Washington, "come in
, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell
where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at
last
 at a critical moment."

Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of
regulars enlisted for t
he war, thoroughly trained and paid according to
some definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at leas
t,
the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that
reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to 
all officers and a
bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this
scheme, which Washington rega
rded as far short of justice to the
soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the
conflict be
fore he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of
meeting British regulars on equal terms.

Though there we
re times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny th
e
time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
forces of regulars in a seven years' war for 
independence. They did
nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,
and Yorktown there we
re the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White
Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen

overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.
"To bring men to be well acquainted with the
 duties of a soldier," wrote
Washington, "requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and
undisciplined rec
ruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
did and perhaps never will happen."

=How the War Was Won.=--T
hen how did the American army win the war? For
one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British
ge
nerals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with
large bodies of regular troops when they might have
 been dealing
paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American
army. "Nothing but the supineness
 or folly of the enemy could have saved
us," solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that
this a
pparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The
ministers behind them believed that a large part of t
he colonists were
loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
war vigorously prosecuted.
 Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
heali
ng. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were
thrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had
 learned many things
about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were
embarrassed by the problem
 of supplies. Their troops could not forage
with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The
l
ong oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
warships of France joined the American privateers i
n preying on supply
boats.

The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
outdone on two imp
ortant occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and
Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense arm
y, which
could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue
the colonies if that hazardous enterp
rise could be accomplished at all.
They learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the
scene of 
endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a
price which staggered even Lord North and George III.
 Moreover, there
were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.

=Women and the War.=--At no time w
ere the women of America indifferent
to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of
opinion t
hey did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth
Timothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773
, a newspaper to
espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James
Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, ear
ly begged her countrymen to rest their case
upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the
leade
rs to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing
about with uncertainty at the Continental Congress
, his wife was writing
letters to him declaring her faith in "independency."

When the war came down upon the country
, women helped in every field. In
sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a
tireless pen comba
tted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.
Almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who ren
dered
service in the "second line of defense." Mrs. Washington managed the
plantation while the General was at the fr
ont and went north to face the
rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her
husband and his men.
 The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah
Bache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set

the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even
near the firing line women were to be found, 
aiding the wounded, hauling
powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
lives.

In the economi
c sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested
crops without enjoying the picturesque title of "farmerett
es" and they
canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their
labor in spinning and weaving it
 is recorded: "Immediately on being cut
off from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their
own 
families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
They thus kept their households decently clad and 
the surplus of their
labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
themselves. In this way the female
 part of families by their industry
and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,
evincing the s
trength of their attachment and the value of their
service."

For their war work, women were commended by high author
ities on more
than one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even
as in our own day. Washington th
anked them for their labors and paid
tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
given to the
 cause of independence.


THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION

When the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little trea
suries in
America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was
in the position of a beggar rather 
than a sovereign. Having no authority
to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
provincials for
 taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
finance the war. "Do you think," boldly inquired one of the
 delegates,
"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
to the printer and get a wagon l
oad of money, one quire of which will
pay for the whole?"

=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appea
ling political
economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of
credit to be redeemed by the s
tates on the basis of their respective
populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about
$241,000,
000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several
states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then 
came
interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions
were also borrowed from France and small 
sums from Holland and Spain. In
desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The
property of To
ries was confiscated and sold, bringing in about
$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to

raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened
with their own affairs, gave little heed.

=Inf
lation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it
rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 177
9 a dollar was worth
only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by
Congress and the states to comp
el people to accept the notes at face
value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.
Speculators coll
ected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of publ
ic
securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley
Forge. "Speculation, peculation, engrossin
g, forestalling," exclaimed
Washington, "afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
virtue. Nothing, I 
am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency
... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes
 of
the enemy."

=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the
war were added the labors of 
private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant
of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,
Jefferso
n, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with
money for their daily needs. All together he contributed
 the huge sum of
half a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,
if not in spirit, a British p
risoner of war. Another Philadelphia
merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the "patriot
financier" bec
ause he labored night and day to find the money to meet
the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When 
his own
funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the
handling of merchandise, he created ag
encies at important points to
distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as
well as financial 
talents.

[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]

Women organized "drives" for money, contributed their plate and their
jewels
, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in
return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a 
pay day pass without
yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,
the issuance of paper mone
y, lotteries, the floating of loans,
borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress
staggered th
rough the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a
 crisis by a
kindly fate.


THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION

When the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers 
and sailors and
their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and
supplies, the writers who sustained
 the American spirit, and the women
who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
achievemen
ts of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was
keenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Co
ngress. They were
fairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of
power and the sympathies, inter
ests, and prejudices of nations and their
rulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening
relati
ons with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and
even military assistance. For the transaction of this
 delicate business,
they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
1775 and prepared to send a
gents abroad.

=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a
friendly ear to the American 
cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a
commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the
"firs
t American diplomat." Later in the year a form of treaty to be
presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin
, Arthur Lee, and
Deane were selected as American representatives at the court of "His
Most Christian Majesty the Kin
g of France." John Jay of New York was
chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the
same year
; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and
Berlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg sp
ent two
fruitless years there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity and
experiencing nothing but humiliation an
d failure." Frederick the Great,
king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for
Silesian linens 
and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,
he refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.

=E
arly French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution
was won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was th
e hero of the occasion,
although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis
XVI's foreign minister, C
ount de Vergennes, before the arrival of any
American representative, had brought to the attention of the king the
op
portunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her
colonies. He showed him how France could redress
 her grievances and
"reduce the power and greatness of England"--the empire that in 1763 had
forced upon her a humili
ating peace "at the price of our possessions,
of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,

Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal." Equally successful in
gaining the king's interest was a curious French 
adventurer,
Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two
popular plays, "Figaro" and "The B
arber of Seville." These two men had
already urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared
on the 
scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential
arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other su
pplies to
the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were
officially refused by the French governme
nt.

=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only
in private by the king's minister, Verge
nnes. The French people,
however, made manifest their affection for the "plain republican" in
"his full dress suit of
 spotted Manchester velvet." He was known among
men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of
extrao
rdinary ability. His "Poor Richard" had thrice been translated
into French and was scattered in numerous editions thr
oughout the
kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,
peasants, and stable boys--knew o
f Franklin and wished him success in
his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a
revolution
 soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging "our dear
republican."

For the king of France, however, this was mo
re serious business. England
resented the presence of this "traitor" in Paris, and Louis had to be
cautious about plu
nging into another war that might also end
disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris
wa
s a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant
exploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and th
e battle with
Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,
the loss of Philadelphia, the 
defeat at Germantown, and the retirement
to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and
Philadelphia--t
wo strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson
and Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his
 British
troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,
cutting New England off from the rest of 
the colonies. No wonder the
king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in
from all sides by th
e American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging
parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October
 17,
1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to
receive the honor.

=Treaties of Alliance
 and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,
placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,
r
eached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends
sat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was w
ith him, grasped at once
the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with
such haste that he 
upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and
his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to a
id the
Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
in February, 1778. The independence of 
the United States was recognized
by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.
Combined milita
ry action was agreed upon and Louis then formally
declared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fou
ght
one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of
Abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war 
on the Empire that Pitt
had erected and that George III was pulling down.

=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a fe
w months, Spain, remembering
the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and
hoping to drive the
 British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the
concert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of

armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high
seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces o
f Spain, France, and
America to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England
was added the danger of a
 possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit
of independence was flaming up.

=The British Offer Terms to America.=-
-Seeing the colonists about to be
joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North
proposed, in Feb
ruary, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn
enactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the ri
ght
of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized
the opening of negotiations through commiss
ioners to be sent to America.
A truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws
suspended, and the o
ld imperial constitution, as it stood before the
opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Eve
nts
had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British
commissioners and diplomats.

=Effects of French Aid
.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,
large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable
bo
dy of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this
help, it meant no sudden change in the fortune
s of war. The British
evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and
Washington's troops were encou
raged to come out of Valley Forge. They
inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable
conduc
t of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of
Philadelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arno
ld, the loss of
Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.

The full effect of the French all
iance was not felt until 1781, when
Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by
French troo
ps Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British
to the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off thei
r escape by sea.
It was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed
without French aid, that put an e
nd to all chance of restoring British
dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that
caused
 Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: "It is all over! It is
all over!" What might have been done without the Fr
ench alliance lies
hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French
soldiers, sailors, officers, mo
ney, and supplies, is known to all the
earth. "All the world agree," exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to
General 
Washington, "that no expedition was ever better planned or
better executed. It brightens the glory that must accompan
y your name to
the latest posterity." Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
reward.


PEACE AT LAST

=British Op
position to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to
the final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it i
s necessary to
remember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home
faced a powerful, informed, a
nd relentless opposition. There were
vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
the unhap
py quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,
and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold
 upon the
American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered
against the government were the first sta
tesmen and orators of the land.
William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American
independence, 
denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
American resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteri
es against
every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while
giving independence to America, woul
d work for reconciliation rather
than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous
sympathy and war
mly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of
statesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like D
avid
Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author
of wide fame and a republican bold enough
 to encourage Washington in
seeing it through.

Against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole arm
y
of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and
their friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it em
ployed in this business,
was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
before printing them. F
ar more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in
time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman

Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a
lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its 
support, causing his
friends to ridicule him in these lines:

    "King George, in a fright
     Lest Gibbon should w
rite
       The story of England's disgrace,
     Thought no way so sure
     His pen to secure
       As to give the
 historian a place."

=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side
of the opponents of the 
government's measures. They had predicted that
conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace

which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.
Every day's news confirmed their predictions and
 lent support to their
arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve
English burdens, made t
hose burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses
were daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single

outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due
British merchants in America were not only 
unpaid but postponed into an
indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French
had a dangerous fl
eet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in
December, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent
 to a
peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on
February 27, 1782, in the House of Commo
ns was carried an address to the
throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,
and other fr
iends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North
gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king
 moaned:
"Necessity made me yield."

In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that
it was p
repared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This
was embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with Fra
nce, the United
States had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
both nations in open conference.
 Finding France, however, opposed to
some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American
commissio
ners conferred with the British agents at Paris without
consulting the French minister. They actually signed a prelim
inary peace
draft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes
reproached him, Franklin replied that 
they "had been guilty of
neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work
would not be ruined by 
a single indiscretion."

=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783
was a triumph for Amer
ica. England recognized the independence of the
United States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundari
es
extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes
to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newf
oundland, and the West Indies
intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.
Spain won Florid
a and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France
gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England 
humbled
and the colonies independent.

The generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called
forth su
rprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way
for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother 
country. At the
same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. "This federal
republic is born a pigmy," w
rote the Spanish ambassador to his royal
master. "A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus
formidable
 to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility
for establishing a new population on immense lands, as we
ll as the
advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans
from all the nations. In a few yea
rs we shall watch with grief the
tyrannical existence of the same colossus."

[Illustration: NORTH AMERICA ACCORDING 
TO THE TREATY OF 1783]


SUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD

The independence of the American colonies was foreseen 
by many European
statesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and
power; but no one could fix th
e hour of the great event. Until 1763 the
American colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There
were 
collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed
with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were 
protests against the
exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on
the whole, the relations b
etween America and the mother country were
more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which
clo
sed in 1688.

The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was
the product of a number of forc
es that happened to converge about 1763.
Three years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,
proud,
 inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his
predecessors, Germans as they were in language and inte
rest, had allowed
things to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would
be king in fact as well as
 in name. About the same time England brought
to a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering

under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly
in defense of the American colonies and nothi
ng seemed more reasonable
to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
the cost of their 
own defense. At this juncture there came into
prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and
contr
olling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,
the English taxpayers were thankful for any promise 
of relief, and
statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set
out upon a new course. She imp
osed taxes upon the colonists, regulated
their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This
action
 evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act
Congress to declare their rights and petition for a redres
s of
grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,
sacked the houses of the king's officers, a
nd tore up the stamped paper.

Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed
the Stamp Act. T
hen it veered again and renewed its policy of
interference. Interference again called forth American protests.
Protes
ts aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent
over to keep order. More irritating laws were passed 
by Parliament.
Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and
seized in the harbor of Charleston.
 The British answer was more force.
The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An
unexpect
ed and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the
spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England
 a proclamation:
"The Americans are rebels!"

The die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was mad
e
commander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
volume of paper currency was issued, and foreign
 aid was summoned.
Franklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced
France to throw her sword int
o the balance. Three years later,
Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of
peace, George 
III acknowledged the independence of the United States.
The new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching fr
om the
Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the
sovereign powers of the earth.

In the sph
ere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were
equally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities 
were driven
from the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.
All the colonies became states, ea
ch with its own constitution or plan
of government. The thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
Article
s of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.
Thus there was begun an adventure in popular governme
nt such as the
world had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down
and be supplanted by a monarch
y? The fate of whole continents hung upon
the answer.

PART III. THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS




CHAPTER VII

THE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION


THE PROMISE
 AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA

The rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed
by official
s popularly elected under constitutions drafted by "the plain
people," was the most significant feature of the eighte
enth century. The
majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
possible naturally looked upon t
heir work and pronounced it good. Those
Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that
the De
claration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm "uninstruc
ted by experience,"
could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All
around them they saw cha
os in finance and in industry and perils for the
immediate future.

=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=-
-The government under
the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
necessary to cope with
 the problems of reconstruction left by the war.
The sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to

seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
paid by the state. In determining all questi
ons, each state had one
vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no
president to enforce t
he laws. Congress was given power to select a
committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body

when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved
a failure. There was no system of national c
ourts to which citizens and
states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
they could compel
 obedience to law. The two great powers of government,
military and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, c
ould
authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
of contributions to meet its bills. It co
uld also order the
establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply
their respective quotas o
f soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring
any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It
coul
d act only through the medium of the state governments.

=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of publi
c finance,
the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was
still outstanding. Congress was u
nable to pay either the interest or the
principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of
their bon
ds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The
current bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one compla
ined, there was
not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
the transactions of the shad
ow legislature. The currency was in utter
chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere
tras
h worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression
of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: "no
t worth a
Continental." To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring
new streams of paper money from the
 press. Almost the only good money in
circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the
public was
 even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
clipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was uns
ettled. The
entire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the
Americans, and Congress, having no p
ower to regulate foreign commerce,
was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.
Domestic 
commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which
erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The cond
ition of the
currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,
as if to increase the confusion,
 backward states enacted laws hindering
the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which
nothing bu
t a national system of courts could cure.

=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the
l
aws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the
Congress of the United States fell into utter dis
repute. It called upon
the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be
treated with contempt. E
ven its own members looked upon it as a solemn
futility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and

many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
Again and again it was impossible to secure a qu
orum for the transaction
of business.

=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to
pursue th
eir own course with no interference from without, had almost as
many difficulties as the Congress. They too were load
ed with
revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
population. Oppressed by their financial 
burdens and discouraged by the
fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of
several states joine
d in a concerted effort and compelled their
legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in
val
ue, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
old accounts.

In every part of the country legis
lative action fluctuated violently.
Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
third year
. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
canceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the 
natural
consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
states to issue bills of credit, to ma
ke paper money legal tender in
payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily
in debt, on th
e other hand, urged even more drastic action against
creditors.

So great did the discontent of the farmers in New Ha
mpshire become in
1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the
taxes and the issuance of pap
er money. It was with difficulty that an
armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the
lea
dership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,
organized that same year open resistance to the governm
ent of the state.
Shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
foreclosing mortgages upon th
e debt-burdened farmers, against the
lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the
senate of the
 state the members of which were apportioned among the
towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy 
taxes, and
against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized
the towns of Worcester and Spring
field and broke up the courts of
justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,
sending a shoc
k of alarm to every center and section of the young
republic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin a
ble to
quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state
government did not dare to execute any of t
he prisoners because they had
so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the
legislature who had 
been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
were defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assi
stance
for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
emphasized by men who were opposed to revol
utionary acts.

=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,
watching the drift of affairs, were
 slowly driven to the conclusion that
the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
careening into
 anarchy. "The facts of our peace and independence," wrote
a friend of Washington, "do not at present wear so promisi
ng an
appearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,
jealousies, and turbulence of the people at time
s almost stagger my
confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to
think that they will show t
hemselves unworthy of the noble prize for
which we have contended."

Washington himself was profoundly discouraged. O
n hearing of Shays's
rebellion, he exclaimed: "What, gracious God, is man that there should
be such inconsistency and
 perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the
other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
u
nder which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn 
them." The same year he
burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. "I am
told that even respect
able characters speak of a monarchical government
without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is

often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a
triumph for our enemies to verify their predict
ions! What a triumph for
the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
ourselves!"

ADVENTURE  I.  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

I.


To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman.
 I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her
 sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were
 abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observ
ing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke 
of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for draw
ing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delic
ate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his ment
al results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturb
ing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the lat
e Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us aw
ay from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first 
finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed 
every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old bo
oks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energ
y of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense fac
ulties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which ha
d been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of h
is summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson br
others at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the re
igning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of 
the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888-
-I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through B
aker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and wit
h the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he
 was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, sp
are figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head 
sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and mann
er told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent
 of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

His ma
nner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kind
ly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in th
e corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you
," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered
.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observ
e. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How 
do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant g
irl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuri
es ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my c
lothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but
 there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands togethe
r.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelig
ht strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has 
very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double
 deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of
 the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark o
f nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secr
eted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profess
ion."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give 
your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it mys
elf, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I beli
eve that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down int
o an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the 
steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then
 how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is ju
st my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you
 are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experi
ences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying ope
n upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, and without either sig
nature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who des
ires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Euro
pe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be 
exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not
 take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it me
ans?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist f
acts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?"

I carefu
lly examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.

"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,"
 I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a p
acket. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English pap
er at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a s
mall "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no 
doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the Ger
man for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.
' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--
here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the s
cene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you 
make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was ma
de in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar constructio
n of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have wr
itten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is want
ed by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, i
f I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating 
wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Ye
s," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty gui
neas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."


"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would 
be a pity to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit
 down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon t
he stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Com
e in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest
 and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad t
aste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep
 blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a bro
och which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at 
the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearan
ce. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past 
the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised
 to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hang
ing lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he
 asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from on
e to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and coll
eague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"

"You 
may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man o
f honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer 
to communicate with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "I
t is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Count shrugg
ed his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the 
end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight 
it may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," c
ontinued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may conf
ess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holm
es dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow t
o be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter
 implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."

"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, 
settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the l
anguid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energ
etic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"If your Majest
y would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

The man sprang from hi
s chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the 
mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to 
conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing W
ilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."

"But you c
an understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "
you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate t
hat I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the
 purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly
 these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,
 Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes witho
ut opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so
 that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case 
I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a mo
nograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--h
um! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quit
e so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, an
d is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."


"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produ
ce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is the writing."


"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought.
"

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.
"

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised yourself seriously."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am
 but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We have tried and failed."

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."


"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. 
Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."

"No sign of 
it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But a very serious one to
 me," returned the King reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"

"To rui
n me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I have heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second d
aughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of
 delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to
 send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of
 steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I shou
ld marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."

"You are sure that she has not sent i
t yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was pub
licly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is ve
ry fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, 
stay in London for the present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."


"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as t
o money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
 to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his clo
ak and laid it on the table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.

Holmes s
cribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.

"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is 
Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
 photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good ne
ws for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you wi
ll be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
."

II.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me
 that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the
 intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it 
was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have alread
y recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indee
d, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp 
of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to 
follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his
 invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon fou
r before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disrep
utable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I ha
d to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he 
emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out
 his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked a
nd laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too f
unny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I supp
ose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel w
as rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the charac
ter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you w
ill know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but bu
ilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, wel
l furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child cou
ld open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach
-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of inter
est.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by on
e wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a gl
ass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say n
othing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biograp
hies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads dow
n in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She l
ives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out
 at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and 
dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the 
advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all abou
t him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to t
hink over my plan of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer
. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his c
lient, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the
 latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field o
f my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
 to understand the situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mi
nd when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aq
uiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cab
man to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.

"He was
 in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and
 down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more fl
urried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, '
Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica 
in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I was just wondering wheth
er I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only ha
lf-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't
 pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she wa
s a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a s
overeign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether 
I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looke
d twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half 
a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enou
gh what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before u
s. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hur
ried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seem
ed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
 aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced rou
nd to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.

" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come!
 Come!'

" 'What then?' I asked.

" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged
 up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
 vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster
, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side
 and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which
 I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there 
had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness 
of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search o
f a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."

"Th
is is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"

"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. I
t looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on m
y part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shal
l drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different di
rections, and I went off to make my own arrangements."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answer
ed, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the
 way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in 
the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am you
r man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tra
y I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided,
 "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scen
e of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."


"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on 
which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing w
hatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into t
he house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to tha
t open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand--so-
-you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite 
follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. 
"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is con
fined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to
 the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain
 neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of f
ire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excel
lent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his b
edroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His br
oad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent c
uriosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His
 expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine ac
tor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

It was a quarter past six when we
 left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was 
already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the
 coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but
 the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourho
od, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissor
s-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who w
ere lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
 the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances a
re that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of
 his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely tha
t she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows 
that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may 
take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that 
double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own 
secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell w
hat indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had reso
lved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But
 it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."


"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble o
f wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."

As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a c
arriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge
. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copp
er, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, wh
ich was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was
 equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, w
as the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and 
sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to t
he ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one directio
n and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking 
part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had 
hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, lookin
g back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no,
 there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."

"He's a brave fellow
," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a r
ough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him
 into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"

Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony
 Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lam
ps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not kno
w whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt mor
e heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the 
grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes
 to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from und
er my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes
 had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw ope
n the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a 
cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentl
emen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room
 and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from withi
n assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the str
eet, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He wa
lked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards
 the Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right.
"

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she 
would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly s
imple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."

"I
 guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed fo
rward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I coul
d fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room,
 which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. T
hey laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."

"How d
id that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to 
rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken adva
ntage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle
 business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that
 our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to sec
ure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She respon
ded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there i
n an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she r
eplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuse
s, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come
 in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now
?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to c
ome with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she 
may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."


"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides
, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King wit
hout delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when 
someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, 
but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before,"
 said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."

III.


I slept 
at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rus
hed into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eager
ly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."


"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started of
f once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to wh
om?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why i
n hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does
 not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Maje
sty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!"
 He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lo
dge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the br
ougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
 questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morn
ing with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back
, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to return."

"And the papers?" as
ked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, f
ollowed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and ope
n drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a
 small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene 
Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My
 friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in t
his way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alar
m of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warn
ed against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your a
ddress had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspici
ous, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actre
ss myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the 
coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed
.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr.
 Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.

"
We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest 
empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better m
an than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to sa
feguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future
. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,


"Very truly yours,  
            
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all
 three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable qu
een? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on
 a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Maj
esty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be 
more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am 
glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This 
ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"Your Majesty ha
s something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The
 King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majest
y. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and,
 turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his ch
ambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. 
Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not hear
d him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the h
onourable title of the woman.

ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE


I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holm
es, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly ge
ntleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly
 into the room and closed the door behind me.

"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," h
e said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room
."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and 
I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
 and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the sett
ee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial
 moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdru
m routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, 
and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."

"Your cases have i
ndeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just befor
e we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary 
combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"A prop
osition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, f
or otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges m
e to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative
 which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that 
the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and oc
casionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have hea
rd, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events 
is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kind
ness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part b
ut also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a 
rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of
 other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to th
e best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pul
led a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement colu
mn, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavo
ured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.


I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace Br
itish tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean blac
k frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bi
t of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar la
y upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing r
ed head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in 
my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts tha
t he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and
 that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up i
n his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the name of good-fortune, 
did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true 
as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than
 your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonr
y?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules
 of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"

"What else 
can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the el
bow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your ri
ght wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to 
the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to Chin
a. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."

Mr. 
Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I
 see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in exp
laining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck 
if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his t
hick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yoursel
f, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the
 late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member 
of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind
 and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, a
t the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had
 twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in
 high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch 
and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You w
ill first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two 
months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said
 Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not 
a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two
 assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages
 so as to learn the business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vince
nt Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.
 Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all,
 if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe
 who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that 
your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never wa
s such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving 
down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he
's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen,
 who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and n
ever had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts,
 if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the of
fice just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, th
at I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.

" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Re
d-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancie
s than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only ch
ange colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, 
Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often
 weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside,
 and I was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with
 his eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'

" 'A
nd what are they worth?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not 
interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, f
or the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

" 
'Tell me all about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the 
League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the 
League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red
-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enor
mous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
 whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'

" 'But,' said I, 'there wo
uld be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is 
really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wante
d to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or 
dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just wal
k in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred po
unds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, s
o that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that
 I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just or
dered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, s
o we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.

"I never hope to s
ee such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his 
hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's 
Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were
 brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-s
etter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I sa
w how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I cou
ld not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps whic
h led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; 
but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most enter
taining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continu
e your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table,
 behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he
 came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did no
t seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable 
to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.


" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

" 'And he is 
admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
 fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then s
uddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

" 'It would be injustice to he
sitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my 
hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he release
d me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
 once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over t
o the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment ca
me up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen exc
ept my own and that of the manager.

" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners
 upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

"I answered that
 I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to h
ear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maint
enance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I
 thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it w
ould be all right.

" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point i
n favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

" 'Well,
 it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.

" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vin
cent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'

" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.

" 'Ten to two.
'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, whi
ch is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my as
sistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 
'And the pay?'

" 'Is $4 a week.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is purely nominal.'

" 'What do you call purely nominal?'

"
 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your who
le position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from t
he office during that time.'

" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.

" 'No excus
e will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lo
se your billet.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it 
in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be
 ready to-morrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once
 more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went
 home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought
 over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole 
affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether pa
st belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copyi
ng out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasone
d myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penn
y bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.

"Well, to
 my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ros
s was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would 
drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon
 the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes,
 and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next
 week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees M
r. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of
 course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was su
ch a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and 
I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might 
get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my 
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morn
ing. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard h
ammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece of
 white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:


THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSO
LVED.

October 9, 1890.


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until 
the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar 
of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his fla
ming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him 
back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refresh
ingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps
 did you take when you found the card upon the door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I calle
d at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an
 accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League.
 He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the nam
e was new to him.

" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

" 'What, the red-headed man?'

" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said
 he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new 
premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

" 'Where could I find him?'

" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me
 the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that addre
ss it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. 
Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice o
f my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But th
at was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard 
that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."

"And you di
d very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From 
what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."


"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerne
d," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, yo
u are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every sub
ject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, an
d who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensiv
e joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And,
 first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisemen
t--how long had he been with you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was
 he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy and would come cheap."


"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in h
is ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

Holmes
 sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears 
are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said H
olmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."

"And has yo
ur business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morn
ing."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or 
two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when ou
r visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most myste
rious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is y
our commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to id
entify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered.
 "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in 
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black cl
ay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, an
d indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his m
ind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked
. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My pract
ice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have som
e lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my 
taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We travelled by the Underg
round as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we 
had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied br
ick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel 
bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "J
ABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his bu
siness. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shinin
g brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looki
ng keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement wi
th his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, cle
an-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would 
go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.

"Smart 
fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for 
daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."

"Evidently," said I
, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquire
d your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And wha
t did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for obs
ervation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explo
re the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retir
ed Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of t
he main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immen
se stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying s
warm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
 that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.

"Let me se
e," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the
 houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the l
ittle newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's car
riage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time
 we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy a
nd harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musi
cian, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat i
n the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while 
his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the rele
ntless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual 
nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, th
e reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature 
took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for
 days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was
 that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the le
vel of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose know
ledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I fe
lt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt
, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some business to do which will take s
ome hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I 
have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matter
s. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at te
n."

"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

I trust that I am not more 
dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Ho
lmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he 
saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confuse
d and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the
 red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he 
had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were
 we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who m
ight play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night shoul
d bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so 
through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard th
e sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom
 I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very
 shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-j
acket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me 
introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples ag
ain, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase.
 All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of
 our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said th
e police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too t
heoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice,
 as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official fo
rce."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I mi
ss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."

"I think you
 will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and t
hat the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it
 will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
 young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him th
an on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he him
self has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every tu
rn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to bui
ld an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."

"I hope 
that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, a
nd I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started
. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very commu
nicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We ratt
led through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"We are close there now
," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thoug
ht it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He h
as one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. H
ere we are, and they are waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselv
es in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow 
passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very mas
sive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formi
dable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, a
nd so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive box
es.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor f
rom below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds 
quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes s
everely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodne
ss to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a cr
ate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lant
ern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy
 him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have at least an hour before us," he rema
rked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minut
e, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as n
o doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is 
the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London 
should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We
 have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some m
onths ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has 
become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate
 upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger 
at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."


"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect th
at within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dar
k lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that,
 as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone 
so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring
 men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand 
behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly
. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of
 the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch 
darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us 
that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch o
f expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.


"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that
 you have done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."

"Then we
 have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterw
ards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be br
eaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to t
he highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my compan
ions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the ban
k director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the gl
int of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a 
yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost woman
ly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing
 fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save t
he single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a
 rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, thr
ough which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly 
about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one k
nee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, 
lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have y
ou the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out 
and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones
 clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the m
an's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no
 chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though 
I see you have got his coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! Yo
u seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-heade
d idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing dow
n holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,
" remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in 
my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "

"All right," said Jones w
ith a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highnes
s to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and w
alked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them f
rom the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and 
defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within m
y experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have be
en at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid
 by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-he
aded League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and
 soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantasti
c business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bri
ght pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it w
ould be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of hi
s accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thou
sands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply fo
r it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the ass
istant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."


"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vu
lgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in h
is house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,
 be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his tric
k of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this 
mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was
 doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more?
 I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went t
o visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether t
he cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant
 answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his f
ace. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. 
They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the
 corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When
 you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the r
esult that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, wh
en they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in o
ther words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be d
iscovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them
 two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifull
y," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."

"It saved me from e
nnui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to esca
pe from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the rac
e," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme
 c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY



"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is
 infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which
 are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great ci
ty, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the planni
ngs, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre r
esults, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."


"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald eno
ugh, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it
 must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing
 a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upo
n the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole
 matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite
 understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who
 is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre.
 But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first head
ing upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading
 it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
 bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your 
example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This i
s the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with i
t. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into
 the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow
, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and
 acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethy
st in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not h
elp commenting upon it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir fro
m the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, g
lancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.

"It was from the reigning family of Holland, thoug
h the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good eno
ugh to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.

"So
me ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being i
nteresting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,
 and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt 
to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one 
rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features o
f interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is 
one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds ga
zing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite 
there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat
 which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peepe
d up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers
 fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across 
the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his c
igarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but i
s not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman
 has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we m
ay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here s
he comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered t
o announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merch
ant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, an
d, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion
 which was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so m
uch typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, sudd
enly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon
 her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"


"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what oth
ers overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Ethe
rege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish 
you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that
 I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away
 to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.

A
gain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house,"
 she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He woul
d not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that th
ere was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."

"Your father," said 
Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it so
unds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes,
 mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, an
d a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he l
eft a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he m
ade her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and 
interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock H
olmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the gre
atest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"

"Oh, no, 
sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per c
ent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely
," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no d
oubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an i
ncome of about $60."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at 
home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of
 course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, an
d I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do
 from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my f
riend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection
 with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her ja
cket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and t
hen afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us
 to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set
 on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all f
ather's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had n
ever so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business
 of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosme
r Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your havin
g gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and s
aid there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball 
you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next 
day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for wa
lks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."

"No?"

"Well
, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
 say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her o
wn circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
 you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and b
etter not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took
 the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."

"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this
 time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in
 an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What office?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where 
did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenha
ll Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till call
ed for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters
 from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wro
te them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between 
us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."

"It wa
s most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most im
portant. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He wo
uld rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiri
ng and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he to
ld me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dre
ssed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."


"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the hou
se again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, wit
h my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to 
make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
 of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both sa
id never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him.
 I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older 
than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its Fre
nch offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; 
for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, f
or the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cros
s, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there we
re two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab 
in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he n
ever did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could 
not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, a
nd I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."

"It seems to me that 
you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
 the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforese
en occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge so
oner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."

"Mo
st certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I
 believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happ
ened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother tak
e the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."

"And your father? Did you t
ell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again
. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if
 he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but H
osmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened?
 And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled
 a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," sai
d Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest up
on me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your me
mory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happ
ened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letter
s of his which you can spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and 
here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's addr
ess you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the
 great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave 
the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not 
allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He s
hall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble
 in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table 
and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few 
minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upw
ard to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and
, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of i
nfinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting t
han her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my ind
ex, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there
 were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a
 good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not 
know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of slee
ves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather 
from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather
 of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. 
Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves
 were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging
 gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Hol
mes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You ha
ve really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the 
method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upo
n details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the
 trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. 
The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. T
he sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest 
from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observ
ing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which s
eemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested o
n glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really 
odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lo
wer buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise
 neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came
 away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.


"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed th
at her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained
 with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark
 would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to busines
s, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip
 to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft.
 seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-w
hiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat f
aced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-s
ided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said 
Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them
 to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike yo
u."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little '
Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rathe
r vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear
 fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were 
that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."

"No, that was n
ot the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the o
ther is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-mor
row evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothin
g until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."

I had h
ad so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I fel
t that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery 
which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of
 the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary 
circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not
 unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the n
ext evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappear
ing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the ti
me, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that
 I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too 
late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his
 long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pu
ngent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to
 him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no, the myste
ry!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the mat
ter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I f
ear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

The q
uestion was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall i
n the passage and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has writ
ten to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"

The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some
 thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully s
harp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboa
rd, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I t
hink that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir.
 I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has
 troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was 
quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she 
is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are 
not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. B
esides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes 
quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a 
violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes
, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two
 of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark
 in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight
 defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"We do al
l our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glanci
ng keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, M
r. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter an
d its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters whic
h purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and th
e 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristic
s to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot
 waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me 
know when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you kno
w, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about
 him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting ou
t of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impos
sible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed i
nto a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.

"I 
am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a tri
ck in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me 
if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly cru
shed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, bega
n talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"The man married a woman very much older than himself for he
r money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a cons
iderable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an 
effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways
, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to r
emain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather 
do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people
 of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, 
and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He 
conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he di
sguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy wh
iskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he
 appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," gro
aned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be
, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in Franc
e, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions,
 and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it 
was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were m
eetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But th
e deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do wa
s clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon t
he young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fi
delity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very mor
ning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to hi
s fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he br
ought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one 
door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had r
ecovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer u
pon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be
 sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from th
e first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constrai
nt."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never wa
s a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your
 shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part
 of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two 
swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy ha
ll door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.


"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That f
ellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some re
spects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remark
ed.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his c
urious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could se
e, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the 
other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,
 as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, whi
ch, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample
 of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."

"And ho
w did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which thi
s man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a di
sguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whe
ther it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewr
iter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his rep
ly was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from W
esthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their empl
oye, James Windibank. Voila tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember 
the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delus
ion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."

ADVENTURE IV. 
THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY


We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a tele
gram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:

"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for
 from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and
 scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."

"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will
 you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your wo
rk for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always
 so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through o
ne of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."

My experience of ca
mp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and s
imple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherl
ock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey 
travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a 
considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worth
less or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."

We had the carriage to ourselv
es save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with int
ervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic
 ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not se
en a paper for some days."

"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all th
e recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases whi
ch are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almo
st invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In 
this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."

"It is a murder,
 then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking 
personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very
 few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed prop
rietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old coun
try. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australia
n. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they
 should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but
 still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a 
lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear t
o have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCart
hys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants
--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been
 able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his hous
e at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the
 spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning
 at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From t
hat appointment he never came back alive.

"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and
 two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other w
as William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walk
ing alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. Ja
mes McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sigh
t at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the t
ragedy that had occurred.

"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost si
ght of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A gi
rl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of 
the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the la
ke, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder
 using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was 
so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two
 McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said
 the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood,
 and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right h
and and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out 
upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The inj
uries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the
 grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict 
of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates
 at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out befor
e the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstanti
al evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."

"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holme
s thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, y
ou may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, ho
wever, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the cul
prit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbo
uring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection w
ith the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case
 to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly 
digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little
 credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughin
g. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestra
de. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by 
means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very c
learly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade 
would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know t
he military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; 
but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively
 slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the o
ther. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a r
esult. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just po
ssible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points wh
ich were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest
 did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him t
hat he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. Th
is observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds o
f the coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."

"On the contra
ry," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, h
e could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he app
eared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, b
ecause such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best polic
y to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of c
onsiderable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you conside
r that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgo
tten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so importan
t, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear t
o me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on 
far slighter evidence," I remarked.

"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."

"What is the young ma
n's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or
 two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."

He picked out from his
 bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in whi
ch the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of
 the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was
 then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just re
turned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was 
informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the w
heels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, tho
ugh I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Bosc
ombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Cro
wder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my fathe
r. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which
 was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appe
ared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued whic
h led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion wa
s becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,
 when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the grou
nd, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knel
t beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask
 for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was 
not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies
. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?

"W
itness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.

"The Coroner: What did you understand
 by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.

"The Coroner: What was the point
 upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.

"The Coroner: I am
 afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has not
hing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out 
to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.


"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you an
d your father?

"Witness: It was.

"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before h
e even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.

"A Juryman: 
Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally 
injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Coroner: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I
 rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I
 ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat 
of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.

" 'Do you mean 
that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" 'Yes, it was gone.'

" 'You cannot say what it was?'

" 'No, I had 
a feeling something was there.'

" 'How far from the body?'

" 'A dozen yards or so.'

" 'And how far from the edge o
f the wood?'

" 'About the same.'

" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'

" 'Y
es, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded the examination of the witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced dow
n the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, 
and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal t
o give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are al
l, as he remarks, very much against the son."

Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cu
shioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points i
n the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too 
little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much
, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of
 the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is tru
e, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word sh
all I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in 
twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and 
over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, f
urtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggin
gs which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Ya
rd. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

"I have ordered a carriage,
" said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you
 had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely 
a question of barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? 
Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and 
the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shal
l use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions fro
m the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it become
s. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have
 your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. W
hy, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of 
the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush 
upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlo
ck Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening u
pon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it
. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We hav
e known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hea
rted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,"
 said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have formed
 some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"I think 
that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You h
ear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in 
forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his 
quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was c
oncerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many
 disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have a
lways loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--an
d--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one
 of them."

"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"

"No, he was averse to it also. No o
ne but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his ke
en, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morro
w?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The doctor?"

"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been st
rong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he i
s a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old 
days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where,
 as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."

"Yes, certainly."

"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material 
assistance to me."

"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James
. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home no
w, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She hurr
ied from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the stre
et.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up
 hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."

"I think that I see m
y way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and
 me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see
 him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be aw
ay a couple of hours."

I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little t
own, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
 The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, an
d I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and
 gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story w
ere absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurr
ed between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into th
e glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal somethin
g to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account
 of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the
 left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my ow
n head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as w
hen seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might
 have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then ther
e was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudde
n blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. Bu
t what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey 
cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
 overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son 
was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thi
ng was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could 
not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.

It was 
late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

"The gla
ss still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are abl
e to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, 
and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."

"And what did you learn from
 him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who ha
d done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a ve
ry quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."

"I cannot admire his taste," I
 remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner
."

"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ag
o, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what
 does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows
 a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he woul
d give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which mad
e him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
 Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very har
d man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the 
last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has 
come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be ha
nged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyar
d, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all tha
t he has suffered."

"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"

"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particular
ly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone coul
d not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murde
red man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which t
he case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until
 to-morrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock 
Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.

"There is serious
 news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaire
d of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life 
abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an 
old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Fa
rm rent free."

"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Eve
rybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."

"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McC
arthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still tal
k of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksu
re manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know
 that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?"

"
We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle fac
ts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."

"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it 
very hard to tackle the facts."

"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,
" replied Lestrade with some warmth.

"And that is--"

"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and t
hat all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."

"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Hol
mes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left."

"Yes, that is it." It was 
a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the 
grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of th
is horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots whic
h her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had. 
Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard
, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he w
as hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have fa
iled to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes 
shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compress
ed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely anima
l lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remar
k fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently
 he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It w
as damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the s
hort grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made qu
ite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, wh
ile I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed
 towards a definite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is s
ituated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods wh
ich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowne
r's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden gras
s twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact 
spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces whic
h had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very m
any other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and the
n turned upon my companion.

"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.

"I fished about with a rake. I thought t
here might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--"

"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours
 with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how s
imple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here i
s where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. 
But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a b
etter view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking
, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story
. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this,
 then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoe
s! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where
 did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the
 edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way
 to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time 
he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelo
pe and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged s
tone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through t
he wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.

"It has been a case of considerable interest," he
 remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think tha
t I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to ou
r luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."

It was about ten minutes before we regained
 our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.

"Thi
s may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder was done with it."

"I see no marks."

"There
 are none."

"How do you know, then?"

"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was 
no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon."


"And the murderer?"

"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a 
grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several
 other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."

Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still
 a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."

"Nous verro
ns," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and sh
all probably return to London by the evening train."

"And leave your case unfinished?"

"No, finished."

"But the my
stery?"

"It is solved."

"Who was the criminal, then?"

"The gentleman I describe."

"But who is he?"

"Surely it wo
uld not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am
 a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentlema
n with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."

"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have g
iven you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."

Having left Lestrade
 at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought wi
th a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.

"Look here, Watson," he sai
d when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't know quite w
hat to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound."

"Pray do so."

"Well, now, in consider
ing this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they imp
ressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry '
Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you underst
and, but that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will b
egin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."

"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"

"Well, obviously it 
could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was wit
hin earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But 
'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that
 the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia."

"What of the
 rat, then?"

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. "This is a map o
f the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand over part of the map. "Wh
at do you read?"

"ARAT," I read.

"And now?" He raised his hand.

"BALLARAT."

"Quite so. That was the word the man 
uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So
 and so, of Ballarat."

"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.

"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field d
own considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correc
t, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat 
with a grey cloak."

"Certainly."

"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by t
he farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."

"Quite so."

"Then comes our expedition of to-day. B
y an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the person
ality of the criminal."

"But how did you gain them?"

"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of tri
fles."

"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told 
from their traces."

"Yes, they were peculiar boots."

"But his lameness?"

"The impression of his right foot was alw
ays less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame."

"But his left-han
dedness."

"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow 
was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-han
ded man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I f
ound the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I ha
ve, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieti
es of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among th
e moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam."

"And the cigar
-holder?"

"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off,
 not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."

"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn
 a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had c
ut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"

"Mr. John Turner,
" cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

The man who entered was a
 strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and ye
t his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of b
ody and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of
 dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostr
ils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chron
ic disease.

"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my note?"

"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it u
p. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."

"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."


"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his ques
tion was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It is so. I know all about
 McCarthy."

The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not have let the young man
 come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes."

"I am glad to
 hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break he
r heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."

"It may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?
"

"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in 
her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."

"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes f
or years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than
 in a gaol."

Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. "Just 
tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I co
uld produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unles
s it is absolutely needed."

"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, 
so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; i
t has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.

"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. H
e was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upo
n me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.

"It was in t
he early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything;
 I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what yo
u would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a stat
ion from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went
 under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.

"One day a gold convoy came down from 
Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a 
close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before
 we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord
 that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remem
ber every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being susp
ected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this e
state, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way 
in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when s
he was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I tur
ned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.


"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot 
to his foot.

" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. There's t
wo of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine, law-abiding country is Englan
d, and there's always a policeman within hail.'

"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them
 off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfu
lness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he s
oon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it
 was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He aske
d for Alice.

"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed
 a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cu
rsed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I s
tood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses t
o talk it over.

"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tr
ee until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermo
st. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut f
rom off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a m
an as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly str
ong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silenc
e that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdo
m to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer
. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back h
is son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped
 in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."

"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said
 Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a 
temptation."

"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"

"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aw
are that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, 
and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secr
et, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."

"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own dea
thbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and 
shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.

"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "
Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of 
Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.' "

James McCarthy was acquitted at 
the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defendi
ng counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect th
at the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past
.

ADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS


When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between
 the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matte
r to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and ot
hers have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which i
t is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narrati
ves, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations found
ed rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however
, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give 
some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probab
ly never will be, entirely cleared up.

The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less inte
rest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventur
e of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furnitu
re warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures o
f the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be r
emembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours
 before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest impo
rtance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singula
r features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.

It was in the latter 
days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and 
the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to 
raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental force
s which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, th
e storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodil
y at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Rus
sell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the 
rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days
 I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.

"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was
 surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"

"Except yourself I have none," he answere
d. "I do not encourage visitors."

"A client, then?"

"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man ou
t on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's."

Sherl
ock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He s
tretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must 
sit.

"Come in!" said he.

The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly
 clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, an
d his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in 
the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed 
down with some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust th
at I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."

"Give m
e your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up f
rom the south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Horsham."

"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is qui
te distinctive."

"I have come for advice."

"That is easily got."

"And help."

"That is not always so easy."

"I ha
ve heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."

"Ah,
 of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."

"He said that you could solve anything."

"He said too 
much."

"That you are never beaten."

"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman."

"But
 what is that compared with the number of your successes?"

"It is true that I have been generally successful."

"The
n you may be so with me."

"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to 
your case."

"It is no ordinary one."

"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal."

"And yet
 I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain
 of events than those which have happened in my own family."

"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us
 the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to
 be most important."

The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.

"My name," sa
id he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business.
 It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the a
ffair.

"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small f
actory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw un
breakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome comp
etence.

"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was r
eported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where 
he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three
 or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had mad
e a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his
 dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempere
d, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Hor
sham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he 
would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of b
randy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.

"
He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve o
r so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me
 live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and 
draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that b
y the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do 
what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had 
a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either
 me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see mo
re than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.

"One day--it was in March, 
1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for
 him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!'
 said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five litt
le dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my 
lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he gla
red at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my
 sins have overtaken me!'

" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.

" 'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired 
to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner fl
ap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What coul
d be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming 
down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox
, in the other.

" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that
 I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'

"I did as he ordered, and whe
n the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a 
mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at 
the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the 
envelope.

" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and a
ll its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in pe
ace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry 
to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where M
r. Fordham shows you.'

"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident 
made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind wit
hout being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, th
ough the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives.
 I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society
. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in
 a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, scr
eaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil.
 When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, li
ke a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have
 seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.

"Well, to come
 to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those dr
unken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little 
green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two
 feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who 
knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to
 meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some $14,000, which
 lay to his credit at the bank."

"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one of the most rem
arkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the dat
e of his supposed suicide."

"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night o
f May 2nd."

"Thank you. Pray proceed."

"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a ca
reful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents 
had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and
 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the paper
s which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save 
a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some of them were of the war ti
me and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date durin
g the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a st
rong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.

"Well, it was the beginning 
of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of '85. On 
the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-
table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched 
palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looke
d very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.

" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?
' he stammered.

"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.

"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,'
 he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?'

" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I re
ad, peeping over his shoulder.

" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.

" 'The sundial in the garden. There is no o
ther,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'

" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. '
We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?'

" 'From
 Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.

" 'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do wi
th sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.'

" 'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said
.

" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'

" 'Then let me do so?'

" 'No, I forbid you. I won't hav
e a fuss made about such nonsense.'

"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about
, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.

"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father we
nt from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill
. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In th
at, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to
 come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying 
senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousne
ss. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and th
e chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefull
y as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of mu
rder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roa
ds. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul pl
ot had been woven round him.

"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose
 of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my un
cle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.

"It was in January, '85, that my po
or father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily 
at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the l
ast generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in w
hich it had come upon my father."

The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the tabl
e he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.

"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is London-
-eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the 
papers on the sundial.' "

"What have you done?" asked Holmes.

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"To tell the truth"--he sank 
his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake
 is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no pre
cautions can guard against."

"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but ene
rgy can save you. This is no time for despair."

"I have seen the police."

"Ah!"

"But they listened to my story wit
h a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and tha
t the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warning
s."

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!" he cried.

"They have, however, allowed me 
a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."

"Has he come with you to-night?"

"No. His orders were to stay in
 the house."

Again Holmes raved in the air.

"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not co
me at once?"

"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised
 by him to come to you."

"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have
 no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?
"

"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured,
 blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance," said he, "that on the day when my uncle
 burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colou
r. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers 
which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention 
of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
 undoubtedly my uncle's."

Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragge
d edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmat
ical notices:

"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.

"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and

        John Swa
in, of St. Augustine.

"9th. McCauley cleared.

"10th. John Swain cleared.

"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."

"Tha
nk you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose anot
her instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act."

"What
 shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you hav
e shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers 
were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will ca
rry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you un
derstand?"

"Entirely."

"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that
 by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remo
ve the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."


"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I sha
ll certainly do as you advise."

"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for
 I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go b
ack?"

"By train from Waterloo."

"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in saf
ety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."

"I am armed."

"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upo
n your case."

"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"

"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it
."

"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your a
dvice in every particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain s
plashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elemen
ts--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.

Sherlock
 Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. The
n he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the 
ceiling.

"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this."


"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."

"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be wa
lking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos."

"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to
 what these perils are?"

"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.

"Then what are they? Who is th
is K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"

Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon
 the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once be
en shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but al
so all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation
 of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to 
accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alon
e can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the a
id of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able
 to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a po
ssession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accompl
ishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to hi
m in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early
 days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."

"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singul
ar document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound a
s regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensa
tional literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and
 tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."

Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I
 say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is lik
ely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, 
for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Ki
ndly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now l
et us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong pres
umption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change 
all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial 
town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we ma
y assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it
 was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his 
successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"

"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee,
 and the third from London."

"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"

"They are all seaports. That the wri
ter was on board of a ship."

"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability--the str
ong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pon
dicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. D
oes that suggest anything?"

"A greater distance to travel."

"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."


"Then I do not see the point."

"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sai
ling-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their missi
on. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a s
teamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think
 that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing ves
sel which brought the writer."

"It is possible."

"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgenc
y of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time whic
h it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upo
n delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?"

"The papers which Openshaw carried 
are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that t
here must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a 
coroner's jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their 
papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of
 an individual and becomes the badge of a society."

"But of what society?"

"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes,
 bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

"I never have."

Holmes turned o
ver the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently:

" 'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the 
fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Con
federate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts
 of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for politic
al purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of th
ose who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fan
tastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On 
receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the
 matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was
 the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any ma
n succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For so
me years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classe
s of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there
 have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'

"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the vo
lume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with
 their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more i
mplacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first m
en in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."

"Then the page 
we have seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, s
ent the society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and f
inally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light i
nto this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told 
him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for 
half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men."

It had cleared in the morni
ng, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock 
Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.

"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I 
foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's."

"What steps will you take?" I ask
ed.

"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."


"You will not go there first?"

"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up y
our coffee."

As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon 
a heading which sent a chill to my heart.

"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."

"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup
, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

"My eye caught the
 name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:

" 'Between nine and ten last
 night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in t
he water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it 
was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body
 was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which
 was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have 
been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he m
issed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited n
o traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, whi
ch should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stage
s.' "

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.

"That hurts my
 pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matt
er with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, 
and that I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable 
agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.

"They m
ust be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on t
he direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, 
Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"

"To the police?"

"No; I shall be my own pol
ice. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before."

All day I was engaged in my professional wor
k, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was ne
arly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from th
e loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.

"You are hungry," I remarked.

"Sta
rving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast."

"Nothing?"

"Not a bite. I had no time to thin
k of it."

"And how have you succeeded?"

"Well."

"You have a clue?"

"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young O
penshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well 
thought of!"

"What do you mean?"

He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the 
pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H
. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia."

"Th
at will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as su
re a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."

"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"

"The leader of the gang.
 I shall have the others, but he first."

"How did you trace it, then?"

He took a large sheet of paper from his pock
et, all covered with dates and names.

"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of th
e old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in '83
. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone 
Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is th
at which is given to one of the states of the Union."

"Texas, I think."

"I was not and am not sure which; but I kne
w that the ship must have an American origin."

"What then?"

"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that t
he barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels whi
ch lay at present in the port of London."

"Yes?"

"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albe
rt Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. 
I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that 
she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."

"What will you do, then?"

"Oh, I have my han
d upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns an
d Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has 
been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this l
etter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon 
a charge of murder."

There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Opens
haw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselve
s, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of t
he Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shat
tered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and th
at is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.

ADVENTURE  VI.  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP


Isa 
Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addi
cted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having r
ead De Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to
 produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid
 of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends a
nd relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair
, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.

One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour wh
en a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down i
n her lap and made a little face of disappointment.

"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."

I groaned, for 
I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the l
inoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.


"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw h
er arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a lit
tle help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an id
ea who you were when you came in."

"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. F
olk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.

"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must 
have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James o
ff to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for two days
. I am so frightened about him!"

It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me
 as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we coul
d find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?

It seems that it wa
s. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farth
est east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and sh
attered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among
 the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure 
of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, mak
e her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?

There was the case
, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,
 why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manag
e it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he wer
e indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room 
behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the futu
re only could show how strange it was to be.

But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. U
pper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east 
of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black g
ap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the ste
ps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above
 the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and te
rraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.

Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimps
e of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upwa
rd, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered li
ttle red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipe
s. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voi
ce, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own though
ts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, 
beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, 
and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.

As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a p
ipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "
There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."

There was a movement and an exclamat
ion from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.

"My 
God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, wh
at o'clock is it?"

"Nearly eleven."

"Of what day?"

"Of Friday, June 19th."

"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednes
day. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a h
igh treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be 
ashamed of yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, fo
ur pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand
! Have you a cab?"

"Yes, I have one waiting."

"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Wa
tson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."

I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of 
sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As
 I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk pas
t me, and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have co
me from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an o
pium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took 
two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonish
ment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the d
ull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than She
rlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the c
ompany once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you do
ing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to 
get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you."

"I have a cab 
outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mi
schief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot
 with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."

It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock
 Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I 
felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the re
st, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which w
ere the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out t
o the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opiu
m den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and
 an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter
.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the
 other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views."

"I was certainly surprised to find 
you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."

"I came to find a friend."

"And I to find an enemy."

"An enemy?
"

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very re
markable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before no
w. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase; for I have used it before 
now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-doo
r at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has pass
ed through it upon the moonless nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"

"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men
 if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the who
le riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here." 
He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle f
rom the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.

"Now, Watson," said Holme
s, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lant
erns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"

"If I can be of use."

"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronic
ler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."

"The Cedars?"

"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house
. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry."

"Where is it, then?"

"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile dr
ive before us."

"But I am all in the dark."

"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up here. A
ll right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her hea
d. So long, then!"

He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre a
nd deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky 
river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only
 by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull 
wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the cl
ouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while
 I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet af
raid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the frin
ge of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of
 a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.

"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he
. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to,
 for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when
 she meets me at the door."

"You forget that I know nothing about it."

"I shall just have time to tell you the fact
s of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's 
plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case clearly and concisel
y to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."

"Proceed, then."

"Some years ago--to be d
efinite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money
. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made frie
nds in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He 
had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by 
the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits
, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whol
e debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standi
ng to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have b
een weighing upon his mind.

"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking b
efore he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box 
of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his depa
rture, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at th
e offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of 
the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clai
r had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and foun
d herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?"


"It is very clear."

"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing
 about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was w
alking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husban
d looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and
 she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, 
and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistibl
e force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat,
 such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.

"Convinced that something was amiss with h
im, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and ru
nning through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stai
rs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts 
as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down 
the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way t
o their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprie
tor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fa
ct, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, 
made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afte
rnoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. 
Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid fro
m it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.

"This disco
very, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The
 rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished 
as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wha
rf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four 
and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood we
re to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thr
ust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his 
coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these
 garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone fo
r no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save
 himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.

"And now as to the villains
 who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, b
ut as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her
 husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was o
ne of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and t
hat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.

"So much for the Lascar man
ager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last h
uman being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is fam
iliar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regula
tions he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand s
ide, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily sea
t, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity d
escends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once
 before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has
 reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A 
shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer e
dge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to 
the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he i
s ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we
 now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we ar
e in quest."

"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?"

"
He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nu
rtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for
 by exceptional strength in the others."

"Pray continue your narrative."

"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight o
f the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to
 them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the p
remises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresti
ng Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the La
scar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incr
iminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger
, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the w
indow not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He deni
ed strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as m
uch a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the
 window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police
-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clu
e.

"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's 
coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the poc
kets?"

"I cannot imagine."

"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--
421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a
 different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted 
coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river."

"But I understand that all the other 
clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"

"No, sir, but the facts might be met spe
ciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye wh
ich could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of 
the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to h
im that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried t
o force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the 
street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of hi
s beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's si
nking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps belo
w, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."

"It certainly sounds feasible."

"Well, we 
will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the s
tation, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known a
s a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at
 present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened
 to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solu
tion as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple
 and yet which presented such difficulties."

While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events
, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind,
 and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two
 scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.

"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my co
mpanion. "We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle 
of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman 
whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are you not co
nducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. S
t. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welc
ome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, t
here, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out
 to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house
. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mo
usseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined agai
nst the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head an
d face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing 
that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head
 and shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"None."

"No bad?"

"No."

"Thank God for that. But come in. You must 
be weary, for you have had a long day."

"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in sever
al of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investiga
tion."

"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that m
ay be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us."

"My dear madam," 
said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any 
assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy."

"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady 
as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much li
ke to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer."

"Certainly, madam."

"D
o not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real op
inion."

"Upon what point?"

"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"

Sherlock Holmes seemed t
o be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him 
as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."

"You think that he is dead?"

"I do."

"Murd
ered?"

"I don't say that. Perhaps."

"And on what day did he meet his death?"

"On Monday."

"Then perhaps, Mr. Holm
es, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."

Sherlock Holmes spr
ang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.

"What!" he roared.

"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up 
a little slip of paper in the air.

"May I see it?"

"Certainly."

He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoo
thing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it 
over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date o
f that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.

"Coarse writing," murmured Hol
mes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."

"No, but the enclosure is."

"I perceive also that whoever 
addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address."

"How can you tell that?"

"The name, you see, is in
 perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has 
been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has w
ritten the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not fam
iliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. H
a! there has been an enclosure here!"

"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."

"And you are sure that this is your
 husband's hand?"

"One of his hands."

"One?"

"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writin
g, and yet I know it well."

" 'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may 
take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo 
size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, i
f I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husban
d's hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words."

"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clai
r, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over."

"But he must be alive, Mr. Holme
s."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have 
been taken from him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"

"Very well. It may, however, have been written o
n Monday and only posted to-day."

"That is possible."

"If so, much may have happened between."

"Oh, you must not d
iscourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know
 if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-ro
om rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond
 to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"

"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woma
n may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very st
rong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should h
e remain away from you?"

"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."

"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving yo
u?"

"No."

"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"

"Very much so."

"Was the window open?"

"Yes."

"T
hen he might have called to you?"

"He might."

"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"

"Yes."

"A cal
l for help, you thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hands."

"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
 unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"

"It is possible."

"And you thought he was pulled b
ack?"

"He disappeared so suddenly."

"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?"

"No, but
 this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."

"Quite so. Your hu
sband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"

"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his b
are throat."

"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"

"Never."

"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"


"Never."

"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We
 shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow."

A large and comfortable
 double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my n
ight of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go f
or days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of
 view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me
 that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing
-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. Wit
h these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tob
acco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old bria
r pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, 
silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep
, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment
. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, 
but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.

"Awake, Watson?" he asked.

"Yes.
"

"Game for a morning drive?"

"Certainly."

"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sl
eeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a di
fferent man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.

As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that n
o one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news th
at the boy was putting in the horse.

"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I thi
nk, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be ki
cked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now."

"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.


"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have ju
st been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see wh
ether it will not fit the lock."

We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning 
sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in,
 and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis,
 but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.

"It has been in some po
ints a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been as blind as a mo
le, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."

In town the earliest risers were just begi
nning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterl
oo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found our
selves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. On
e of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.

"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.

"Inspector Bradstreet, s
ir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap 
and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room her
e." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. Th
e inspector sat down at his desk.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"

"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the o
ne who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."

"Yes. He was brought
 up and remanded for further inquiries."

"So I heard. You have him here?"

"In the cells."

"Is he quiet?"

"Oh, he 
gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."

"Dirty?"

"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and 
his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; an
d I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."

"I should like to see him very much."

"Would
 you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag."

"No, I think that I'll take it."

"Very good. Com
e this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought 
us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.

"The third on the right is his," said the inspector.
 "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.

"He is asleep," said 
he. "You can see him very well."

We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in 
a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with
 a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirt
y, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran 
right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth
 were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.

"He's a bea
uty, isn't he?" said the inspector.

"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and 
I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my aston
ishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.

"Now, if you will have th
e great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."

"Well, I
 don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his
 key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once mor
e into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously acr
oss and down the prisoner's face.

"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the coun
ty of Kent."

Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark fro
m a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted 
lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting u
p in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and stari
ng about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself
 down with his face to the pillow.

"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him
 from the photograph."

The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be i
t so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"

"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be c
harged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have b
een twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."

"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obv
ious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained."

"No crime, but a very great er
ror has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."

"It was not the wife; i
t was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What 
an exposure! What can I do?"

Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.


"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On 
the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that
 there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, m
ake notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go
 into court at all."

"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even 
execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.

"You are the first who have ev
er heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled
 in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wishe
d to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point 
from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon whi
ch to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in 
the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiabl
e as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured
 plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city,
 ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in t
he evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.

"I wrote my articles and thought little 
more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for $25. I was 
at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor,
 asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I ha
d the money and had paid the debt.

"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a wee
k when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground
, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up 
reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling
 my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swa
ndam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dr
essed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was saf
e in his possession.

"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any b
eggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional a
dvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite 
a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a ve
ry bad day in which I failed to take $2.

"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and e
ventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business 
in the City. She little knew what.

"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opi
um den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street
, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my c
onfidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew 
that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wi
g. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a searc
h in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut wh
ich I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers
 which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window
, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of c
onstables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being ident
ified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.

"I do not know that there is anything else for me to
 explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Kno
wing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no 
constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."

"That note on
ly reached her yesterday," said Holmes.

"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"

"The police have watched this 
Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unob
served. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."

"That was it,"
 said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"

"Many ti
mes; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thin
g up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."

"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."

"In th
at case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must com
e out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew h
ow you reach your results."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an oun
ce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

VII.  THE ADV
ENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE


I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, w
ith the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-go
wn, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near
 at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-f
elt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chai
r suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.

"You are engaged," said I
; "perhaps I interrupt you."

"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter 
is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in connection
 with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction."

I seated myself in his armchair and war
med my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystal
s. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is t
he clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."

"No, no. No crime," 
said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four mi
llion human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
 dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little pro
blem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of su
ch."

"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely 
free of any legal crime."

"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular ca
se of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this sma
ll matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"

"Yes."

"It is to him t
hat this trophy belongs."

"It is his hat."

"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upo
n it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon 
Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of P
eterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very h
onest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. 
In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slu
ng over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little k
not of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swing
ing it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from hi
s assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rush
ing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at 
the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in poss
ession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpea
chable Christmas goose."

"Which surely he restored to their owner?"

"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is 
true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also 
true that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, an
d some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them."

"
What, then, did Peterson do?"

"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the
 smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in sp
ite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried i
t off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentle
man who lost his Christmas dinner."

"Did he not advertise?"

"No."

"Then, what clue could you have as to his identi
ty?"

"Only as much as we can deduce."

"From his hat?"

"Precisely."

"But you are joking. What can you gather from 
this old battered felt?"

"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality
 of the man who has worn this article?"

I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. I
t was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of re
d silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B."
 were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest
, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt t
o hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.

"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.


"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid
 in drawing your inferences."

"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"

He picked it up and
 gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less suggestive th
an it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others wh
ich represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upo
n the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon
 evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken wi
th the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may acc
ount also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."

"My dear Holmes!"

"He has, however, retained 
some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a sedentary life, go
es out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last fe
w days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. A
lso, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."

"You are certainly joking, H
olmes."

"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how th
ey are attained?"

"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For exa
mple, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"

For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came r
ight over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man
 with so large a brain must have something in it."

"The decline of his fortunes, then?"

"This hat is three years ol
d. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed
 silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no ha
t since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."

"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the fo
resight and the moral retrogression?"

Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger u
pon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sig
n of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since 
we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight no
w than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal so
me of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-res
pect."

"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."

"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizz
led, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of t
he lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.
 They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the
 gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors mos
t of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, 
and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training."

"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."


"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon you
r hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enou
gh to lose your wife's affection."

"But he might be a bachelor."

"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-of
fering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."

"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do y
ou deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"

"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when 
I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent con
tact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the oth
er. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"

"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, lau
ghing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose
, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."

Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew 
open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is da
zed with astonishment.

"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.

"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned t
o life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view o
f the man's excited face.

"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out his hand and displayed up
on the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such pur
ity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.

Sherlock Holmes sat up with
 a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?"

"A 
diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty."

"It's more than a precious stone. It is
 the precious stone."

"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.

"Precisely so. I ought to know i
ts size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely
 unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth p
art of the market price."

"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and
 stared from one to the other of us.

"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental consi
derations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover th
e gem."

"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.

"Precisely so, on December 22nd
, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evi
dence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter her
e, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled i
t over, and read the following paragraph:

"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought u
p upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuabl
e gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he
 had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he migh
t solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally 
been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that 
the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was ly
ing empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the 
stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to h
aving heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found mat
ters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, wh
o struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for ro
bbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred
 it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclu
sion and was carried out of court."

"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the
 paper. "The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to th
e crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed 
a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came 
from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. S
o now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this
 little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in a
ll the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."

"What will you say?"

"Give me a penci
l and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry B
aker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."

"Very. B
ut will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. 
He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of n
othing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then
, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention 
to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers."

"In whic
h, sir?"

"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to
 you."

"Very well, sir. And this stone?"

"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just bu
y a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the 
one which your family is now devouring."

When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it agai
nst the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and foc
us of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stan
d for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern 
China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of rub
y red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a s
uicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who wou
ld think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now
 and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."

"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"

"I canno
t tell."

"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?"

"It is,
 I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was
 carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a ve
ry simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."

"And you can do nothing until then?"

"Nothing."

"In tha
t case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, f
or I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."

"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a w
oodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop
."

I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once mo
re. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiti
ng outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we
 were shown up together to Holmes' room.

"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greetin
g his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
 Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watso
n, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"

"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."

He w
as a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard
 of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' su
rmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his
 lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosin
g his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at th
e hands of fortune.

"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an adver
tisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."

Our visitor gave a rat
her shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt 
that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money
 in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."

"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it
."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.

"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyon
e had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perf
ectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"

"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of r
elief.

"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"

The man bu
rst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hard
ly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your p
ermission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard."

Sherlock Holmes 
glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.

"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," s
aid he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, 
and I have seldom seen a better grown goose."

"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gaine
d property under his arm. "There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in t
he Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club,
 by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were 
duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to 
my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his 
way.

"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "It is quite certain that he
 knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"

"Not particularly."

"Then I suggest that we turn
 our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."

"By all means."

It was a bitter night, so
 we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless 
sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply a
nd loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
 Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the 
corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered
 two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good a
s your geese," said he.

"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.

"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Hen
ry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."

"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."

"Indeed! 
Whose, then?"

"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."

"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was
 it?"

"Breckinridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to 
your house. Good-night."

"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the fro
sty air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the 
other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
 that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed 
by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to 
the south, then, and quick march!"

We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to
 Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-l
ooking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.

"Good-evening. It's a
 cold night," said Holmes.

The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.

"Sold out of geese, I
 see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.

"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."

"That
's no good."

"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."

"Ah, but I was recommended to you."

"Who by?"


"The landlord of the Alpha."

"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."

"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did y
ou get them from?"

To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.

"Now, then, mister," sa
id he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."

"It is stra
ight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha."

"Well then, I shan't tel
l you. So now!"

"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.
"

"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there sh
ould be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will y
ou take for the geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over the
m."

"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If y
ou won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I hav
e a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred."

"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snap
ped the salesman.

"It's nothing of the kind."

"I say it is."

"I don't believe it."

"D'you think you know more abo
ut fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha 
were town bred."

"You'll never persuade me to believe that."

"Will you bet, then?"

"It's merely taking your money,
 for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate."

The sale
sman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said he.

The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a gre
at greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.

"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman
, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You se
e this little book?"

"Well?"

"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page
 are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! Y
ou see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read
 it out to me."

"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.

"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."


Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.' "


"Now, then, what's the last entry?"

" 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "

"Quite so. There you are. And
 underneath?"

" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.' "

"What have you to say now?"

Sherlock Holmes looked
 deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of 
a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, no
iseless fashion which was peculiar to him.

"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protrudi
ng out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front of 
him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing m
e on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be det
ermined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It 
is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, a
nd I should--"

His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just
 left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was 
thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists
 fiercely at the cringing figure.

"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you were all at the d
evil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshot
t here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?"

"No; but one of them was 
mine all the same," whined the little man.

"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."

"She told me to ask you."

"Well
, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forwar
d, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.

"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes
. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people w
ho lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder.
 He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.

"Who 
are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.

"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I c
ould not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance
 to you."

"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"

"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my busi
ness to know what other people don't know."

"But you can know nothing of this?"

"Excuse me, I know everything of it
. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Bre
ckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a membe
r."

"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and 
quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-w
heeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market
-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."

The man
 hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a sidelong glance.

"No, no; the real name," 
said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with an alias."

A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the 
stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James Ryder."

"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolit
an. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know."

The littl
e man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whet
her he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were b
ack in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our 
new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.

"Here we are
!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr
. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now
, then! You want to know what became of those geese?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bi
rd, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail."

Ryder quivered with emotion. "
Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"

"It came here."

"Here?"

"Yes, and a most remarkable bird i
t proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brig
htest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum."

Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutch
ed the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone ou
t like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whethe
r to claim or to disown it.

"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! 
Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a 
dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"

For a moment he had staggere
d and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eye
s at his accuser.

"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is
 little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard
, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?"

"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a 
crackling voice.

"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was t
oo much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It
 seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plu
mber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What di
d you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he s
hould be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortun
ate man arrested. You then--"

Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "
For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never wen
t wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's
 sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you th
ought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. 
I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now 
let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open m
arket? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety."

Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "
I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would 
be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it int
o their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if 
on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road
, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a dete
ctive; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. M
y sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbe
ry at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.

"I had a
 friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had 
met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he w
ould be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he 
lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in s
afety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and sear
ched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at 
the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could
 beat the best detective that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her
 geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
 it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds-
-a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat
 as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its 
crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to spea
k to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.

" 'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' 
says she.

" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.'

" 
'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's t
wenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.'

" 'Thank you, Maggie,' sa
ys I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'

" 'The other is a good t
hree pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'

" 'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll 
take it now,' said I.

" 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you want, then?'

" 'That wh
ite one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'

" 'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'

"
Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, 
for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and op
ened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake h
ad occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be 
seen there.

" 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.

" 'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'

" 'Which dealer's?'

" 'Brecki
nridge, of Covent Garden.'

" 'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'

" 
'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.'

"Well, then, of course I saw it al
l, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not
 one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered
 me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself
 a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He
 burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.

There was a long silence, broken only by his heav
y breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend ro
se and threw open the door.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"

"No more words. Get out!"

And 
no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of r
unning footfalls from the street.

"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am no
t retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this f
ellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
 possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to ga
ol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a 
most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the b
ell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature."

VIII.  THE ADVEN
TURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND


On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight 
years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange
, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he 
refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. O
f all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was ass
ociated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the earl
y days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I 
might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been
 freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well th
at the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death o
f Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.

It was early in April in the
 year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a la
te riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked u
p at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.

"Very sorry 
to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retort
ed upon me, and I on you."

"What is it, then--a fire?"

"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a c
onsiderable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young 
ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presu
me that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you 
would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the 
chance."

"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."

I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in h
is professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded 
on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes a
nd was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily ve
iled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.

"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name 
is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as befo
re myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I 
shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."

"It is not cold which makes me shiver," 
said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.
" She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face a
ll drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were thos
e of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock
 Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bend
ing forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train thi
s morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your l
eft glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you rea
ched the station."

The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.

"There is no mystery, 
my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. Th
e marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when 
you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "
I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, 
I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who
 cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from M
rs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you
 not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds 
me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,
 with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."

Holmes turned to his desk a
nd, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.

"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; 
it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be 
happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own re
ward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I
 beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."

"Alas!" replied
 our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend 
so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right
 to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not s
ay so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see d
eeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass
 me."

"I am all attention, madam."

"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last su
rvivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."


Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.

"The family was at one time among the richest in En
gland, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last 
century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventua
lly completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundr
ed-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, l
iving the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself
 to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out 
to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit o
f anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to deat
h and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned
 to England a morose and disappointed man.

"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the you
ng widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two yea
rs old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than $1000 a year--and t
his she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum shou
ld be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was
 killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himsel
f in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mo
ther had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

"But a terrible cha
nge came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, wh
o had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his 
house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper
 approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, be
en intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in
 the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he
 is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith
 over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was 
able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these v
agabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would acce
pt in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion al
so for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboo
n, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.

"You can ima
gine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with u
s, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hai
r had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."

"Your sister is dead, then?"

"She died just two years ago, and it
 is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we wer
e little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss 
Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. 
Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. M
y stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a
 fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my o
nly companion."

Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushi
on, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.

"Pray be precise as to details," said he.

"I
t is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I h
ave already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, th
e sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second
 my sister's, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corri
dor. Do I make myself plain?"

"Perfectly so."

"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal ni
ght Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was trouble
d by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came i
nto mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me
, but she paused at the door and looked back.

" 'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in t
he dead of the night?'

" 'Never,' said I.

" 'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep
?'

" 'Certainly not. But why?'

" 'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, hea
rd a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from
 the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'

" 'No, I have 
not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'

" 'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder 
that you did not hear it also.'

" 'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'

" 'Well, it is of no great consequence, 
at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."

"Ind
eed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"

"Always."

"And why?"

"I think that 
I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were l
ocked."

"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."

"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending m
isfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which 
bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beati
ng and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of
 a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed 
into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments
 later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, 
and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By 
the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands gropin
g for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, bu
t at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain,
 and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her s
he suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled ban
d!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the dire
ction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for 
my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was u
nconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were i
n vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my belo
ved sister."

"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"


"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, amo
ng the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."

"Was your sister dres
sed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a m
atch-box."

"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. A
nd what conclusions did the coroner come to?"

"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct h
ad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed t
hat the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad
 iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all ro
und, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by fo
ur large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were 
no marks of any violence upon her."

"How about poison?"

"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."

"W
hat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"

"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous 
shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."

"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"


"Yes, there are nearly always some there."

"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled b
and?"

"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to
 some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchief
s which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."

Holmes sho
ok his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.

"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your
 narrative."

"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, h
owever, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name 
is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered 
no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were star
ted in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamb
er in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when 
last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whi
stle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room
. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a do
g-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with th
e one object of seeing you and asking your advice."

"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me al
l?"

"Yes, all."

"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."

"Why, what do you mean?"

For ans
wer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little l
ivid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.

"You have been cruelly used," 
said Holmes.

The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps
 he hardly knows his own strength."

There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and
 stared into the crackling fire.

"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a thousand details whic
h I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to 
come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfat
her?"

"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he 
will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and f
oolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."

"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"

"By no me
ans."

"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"

"I have one or two things which I would wish to
 do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.
"

"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you no
t wait and breakfast?"

"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shal
l look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from th
e room.

"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.

"It seems to m
e to be a most dark and sinister business."

"Dark enough and sinister enough."

"Yet if the lady is correct in sayin
g that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must 
have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."

"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and 
what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"

"I cannot think."

"When you combine the ideas of whistles at n
ight, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every r
eason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a b
and, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of tho
se metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that 
the mystery may be cleared along those lines."

"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"

"I cannot imagine."

"I see ma
ny objections to any such theory."

"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran th
is day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the
 devil!"

The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, a
nd that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of 
the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging
 in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to sp
an it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked
 with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, t
hin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.

"Which of you is Holmes?" asked
 this apparition.

"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly.

"I am Dr. Grimesby R
oylott, of Stoke Moran."

"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."

"I will do nothing of the kind.
 My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"

"It is a little cold for the ti
me of the year," said Holmes.

"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.

"But I have heard 
that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.

"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new vi
sitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. Yo
u are Holmes, the meddler."

My friend smiled.

"Holmes, the busybody!"

His smile broadened.

"Holmes, the Scotland 
Yard Jack-in-office!"

Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most entertaining," said he. "When you go out 
close the door, for there is a decided draught."

"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with m
y affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He s
tepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.

"See that you keep you
rself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.

"He s
eems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have sho
wn him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudd
en effort, straightened it out again.

"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective for
ce! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer f
rom her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I s
hall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."

It was nearly o
ne o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over
 with notes and figures.

"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To determine its exact meaning I hav
e been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which 
at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more 
than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both gir
ls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very seriou
s extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for stand
ing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man 
is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Wate
rloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent
 argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need
."

At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and d
rove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy
 clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was
 full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise
 of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arm
s folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Sudden
ly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.

"Look there!" said he.

A heavily 
timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches th
ere jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.

"Stoke Moran?" said he.

"Yes, sir, that be
 the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.

"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "tha
t is where we are going."

"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to th
e left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path 
over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."

"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, 
shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."

We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled ba
ck on its way to Leatherhead.

"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should 
think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Ston
er. You see that we have been as good as our word."

Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a 
face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has
 turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."

"We h
ave had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had o
ccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then.
"

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"


"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must loc
k yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make
 the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."

The building was of grey
, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on e
ach side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly cav
ed in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively
 modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where 
the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, 
but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed l
awn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.

"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you
 used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"

"E
xactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."

"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there do
es not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."

"There were none. I believe that it was an e
xcuse to move me from my room."

"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corrido
r from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"

"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for 
anyone to pass through."

"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now
, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"

Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a c
areful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. 
There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, bu
t they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplex
ity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we 
shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."

A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from 
which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, tha
t in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, 
with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in
 one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. Th
ese articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton ca
rpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discolo
ured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and 
sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.

"Wher
e does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, th
e tassel actually lying upon the pillow.

"It goes to the housekeeper's room."

"It looks newer than the other things
?"

"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."

"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"

"No, I never heard o
f her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."

"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a
 bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself dow
n upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks bet
ween the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over 
to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell
-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's a dummy," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even atta
ched to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little o
pening for the ventilator is."

"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."

"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pul
ling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must
 be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside 
air!"

"That is also quite modern," said the lady.

"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.

"Y
es, there were several little changes carried out about that time."

"They seem to have been of a most interesting ch
aracter--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now ca
rry our researches into the inner apartment."

Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daught
er, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an
 armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the princi
pal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.


"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.

"My stepfather's business papers."

"Oh! you have seen inside, then?
"

"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."

"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"

"No.
 What a strange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.

"No; w
e don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."

"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, an
d yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wis
h to determine." He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attentio
n.

"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something
 interesting!"

The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, how
ever, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.

"What do you make of that, Watson?"

"It's a
 common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied."

"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wi
cked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough n
ow, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."

I had never seen my friend's face so gri
m or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up a
nd down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from h
is reverie.

"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every resp
ect."

"I shall most certainly do so."

"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your
 compliance."

"I assure you that I am in your hands."

"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the nigh
t in your room."

Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.

"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believ
e that that is the village inn over there?"

"Yes, that is the Crown."

"Very good. Your windows would be visible fro
m there?"

"Certainly."

"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather com
es back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put y
our lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the roo
m which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."

"O
h, yes, easily."

"The rest you will leave in our hands."

"But what will you do?"

"We shall spend the night in your
 room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."

"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you h
ave already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.

"Perhaps I have."

"Th
en, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."

"I should prefer to have clearer proofs befor
e I speak."

"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."


"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave
 you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do 
what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."

Sherlock Ho
lmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, a
nd from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. 
At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drov
e him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor
's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later w
e saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.

"Do you know, Watson
," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. 
There is a distinct element of danger."

"Can I be of assistance?"

"Your presence might be invaluable."

"Then I sha
ll certainly come."

"It is very kind of you."

"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms tha
n was visible to me."

"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.
"

"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imag
ine."

"You saw the ventilator, too?"

"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small 
opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."

"I knew that we should find a vent
ilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."

"My dear Holmes!"

"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she sa
id that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a commun
ication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inq
uiry. I deduced a ventilator."

"But what harm can there be in that?"

"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence
 of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"

"
I cannot as yet see any connection."

"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"

"No."

"It was clampe
d to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"

"I cannot say that I have."

"The lady could not 
move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it
, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."

"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at
. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."

"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a do
ctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among t
he heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deep
er still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and 
turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."

About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extingu
ished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just a
t the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.

"That is our signal," said Holmes, spr
inging to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."

As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, 
explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the ni
ght there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twink
ling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.

There was little difficulty in entering the 
grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, cro
ssed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed t
o be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across t
he lawn into the darkness.

"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"

Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His
 hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.


"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."

I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affec
ted. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easie
r in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My c
ompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as
 we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear aga
in so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:

"The least sound would be fatal to our plans.
"

I nodded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator."

I nodded
 again.

"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I wi
ll sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."

I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table
.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of match
es and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.

How shall I ever forget th
at dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat o
pen-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off t
he least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and
 once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away w
e could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, tho
se quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.


Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, 
but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.
 I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an h
our I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that o
f a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, 
struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.

"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"


But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare fla
shing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could
, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gaz
ing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I hav
e ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dre
adful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers
 from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of 
it had died away into the silence from which it rose.

"What can it mean?" I gasped.

"It means that it is all over,"
 Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room
."

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without 
any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.

It 
was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a bri
lliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. 
Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red 
heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.
 His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round hi
s brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we 
entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. I
n an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped
 head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He
 has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
 into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss S
toner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."

As he spoke he drew the dog-whip s
wiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and,
 carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.

Such are the true facts of the d
eath of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already
 run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the mor
ning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion
 that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of
 the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.

"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erron
eous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presenc
e of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearanc
e which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wro
ng scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me t
hat whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attentio
n was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to 
the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the s
uspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea o
f a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supp
ly of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which c
ould not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man 
who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point o
f view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark puncture
s which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recal
l the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk wh
ich we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best,
 with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, p
erhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.

"I had come to these con
clusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of st
anding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe,
 the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The m
etallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon i
ts terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the 
proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.
"

"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."

"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its 
master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon 
the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I can
not say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."

IX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB


Of
 all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our i
ntimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and t
hat of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original obs
erver, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of
 being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which
 he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like
 all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than w
hen the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnish
es a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the
 lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.

It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage,
 that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandon
ed Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo 
his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at 
no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I h
ad cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me
 on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.

One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awake
ned by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consult
ing-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstai
rs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.

"I've got h
im here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his 
manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispe
red. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go no
w, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time t
o thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a sui
t of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handke
rchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should sa
y, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering f
rom some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, 
Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on i
nquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the ma
id a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table."

I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherle
y, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. 
"I regret that I have kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journe
y, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he
, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. 
All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out 
some water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon 
a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-
looking.

"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.

"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the 
water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhap
s you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be."

He unwound the handkerchie
f and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers 
and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the root
s.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably."

"Yes, it did. I fainted wh
en it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still
 bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."

"Excelle
nt! You should have been a surgeon."

"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province."

"T
his has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument."

"A thing like a cleaver," s
aid he.

"An accident, I presume?"

"By no means."

"What! a murderous attack?"

"Very murderous indeed."

"You horri
fy me."

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised 
bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

"How is that?" I asked when I had fi
nished.

"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good dea
l to go through."

"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves."

"Oh, no,
 not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evide
nce of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, a
nd I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can 
give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the
 nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlo
ck Holmes, before you go to the official police."

"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I sho
uld be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you g
ive me an introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged
 to you."

"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you fe
el equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."

"Then my servant will call a cab, and I s
hall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was 
inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.

Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging abou
t his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe,
 which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and coll
ected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs,
 and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow
 beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.

"It is easy to see that your experience ha
s been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us wh
at you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."

"Thank you," said my pat
ient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cu
re. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experience
s."

Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, w
hile I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.

"You m
ust know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a h
ydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to
 Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come int
o a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professio
nal chambers in Victoria Street.

"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary exp
erience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and t
hat is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in 
the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came 
to believe that I should never have any practice at all.

"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the 
office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a car
d, too, with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a ma
n rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His 
whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding b
ones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step bri
sk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty th
an thirty.

" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent. 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hath
erley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a s
ecret.'

"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me 
so good a character?'

" 'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it f
rom the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'

" 'That is quite c
orrect,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional quali
fications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?'

" 'Undoubtedly so. But
 you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy 
is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone t
han from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'

" 'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely d
epend upon my doing so.'

"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspici
ous and questioning an eye.

" 'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.

" 'Yes, I promise.'

" 'Absolute and complet
e silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'

" 'I have alread
y given you my word.'

" 'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open
 the door. The passage outside was empty.

" 'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are someti
mes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and beg
an to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

"A feeling of repulsion, and of something aki
n to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client c
ould not restrain me from showing my impatience.

" 'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time 
is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.

" 'How would fifty guineas fo
r a night's work suit you?' he asked.

" 'Most admirably.'

" 'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer th
e mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what 
is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?'

" 'The work appears 
to be light and the pay munificent.'

" 'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.'

" 'Whe
re to?'

" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of 
Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'

" 'Very good.'

" 'I shall co
me down in a carriage to meet you.'

" 'There is a drive, then?'

" 'Yes, our little place is quite out in the countr
y. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'

" 'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there w
ould be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.'

" 'Yes, we could easily give you a shak
e-down.'

" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?'

" 'We have judged it best that yo
u should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man,
 a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw
 out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'

"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful the
y would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, h
owever, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'

" 'Quite so. It is very natural that
 the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit yo
u to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'


" 'Entirely.'

" 'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and
 that it is only found in one or two places in England?'

" 'I have heard so.'

" 'Some little time ago I bought a sm
all place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a depos
it of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively sma
ll one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, i
n the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was q
uite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true v
alue, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, howeve
r, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should 
earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and i
n order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got o
ut of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once be
came known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the 
facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I 
have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I ma
ke it all plain?'

" 'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use yo
u could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a
 pit.'

" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them
 without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hathe
rley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'

" 
'I shall certainly be there.'

" 'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and 
then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.

"Well, when I came to think it all over in c
ool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me
. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price
 upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and 
manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the full
er's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should t
ell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and start
ed off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.

"At Reading I had to change not only my 
carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit statio
n after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a sin
gle sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the mo
rning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the
 door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as
 fast as the horse could go."

"One horse?" interjected Holmes.

"Yes, only one."

"Did you observe the colour?"

"Ye
s, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut."

"Tired-looking or fresh?"


"Oh, fresh and glossy."

"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting stateme
nt."

"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven m
iles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been 
nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direc
tion, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the 
world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but 
they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
 and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables
, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness
 of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him
, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and in
to the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had cro
ssed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage d
rove away.

"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering unde
r his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our
 direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her
 face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon 
her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though aski
ng a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell
 from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the roo
m from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.

" 'Perhaps you will have the kindn
ess to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly fur
nished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down 
the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished 
into the darkness.

"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that t
wo of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping 
that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was
 a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything
 was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were 
they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, 
that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly ot
her large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain,
 from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my brea
th to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.

"Suddenly, without any preli
minary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in th
e aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful f
ace. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one
 shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancin
g back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.

" 'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it se
emed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.'

" 'But, madam,' s
aid I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'

" 'It is not wo
rth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled
 and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. '
For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'

"But I am somewhat headstrong by
 nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guin
ea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothi
ng? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This 
woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more t
han I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to re
new her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She li
stened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as s
he had come.

"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of
 the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.

" 'This is my secretary and manager,' sai
d the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt
 the draught.'

" 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.'


"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Fergus
on and I will take you up to see the machine.'

" 'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'

" 'Oh, no, it is in the h
ouse.'

" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'

" 'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind 
that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.'

"We went upstairs t
ogether, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with 
corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by th
e generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while
 the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to pu
t on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded t
hem, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see f
rom the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.

"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before
 a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one tim
e. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.

" 'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic
 press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this smal
l chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal f
loor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in
 the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of 
it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we c
an set it right.'

"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic on
e, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which con
trolled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of wa
ter through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the h
ead of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause 
of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several
 practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to t
he main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance tha
t the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an e
ngine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron 
trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scra
ping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of 
the colonel looking down at me.

" 'What are you doing there?' he asked.

"I felt angry at having been tricked by so 
elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should 
be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'

"The in
stant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang u
p in his grey eyes.

" 'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He took a step backward, slammed
 the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secu
re, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'

"And then
 suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the sw
ish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it
 when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, 
as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself
, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the r
emorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my han
d upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depe
nd very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shud
dered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at t
hat deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something whic
h brought a gush of hope back to my heart.

"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls we
re of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, whic
h broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was i
ndeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other
 side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the
 two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.

"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wr
ist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me 
with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishl
y rejected.

" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not t
here. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'

"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggere
d to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, a
nd just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other f
rom the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her
 wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining bri
ghtly.

" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'

"As she spoke a ligh
t sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing for
ward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flun
g open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could
 not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard 
what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determin
ed to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing hi
s way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.

" 'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English,
 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silen
t!'

" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen 
too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon
. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, 
my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.

"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up an
d rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. S
uddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbb
ing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from m
y wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I
 fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.

"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a ver
y long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodd
en with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an inst
ant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be 
safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen
. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, 
which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it 
not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.


"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an
 hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever 
heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for
 me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.

"It was too far 
for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the pol
ice. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind 
enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise."

We both sat in 
silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from t
he shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.

"Here is an advertisement which wil
l interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., M
r. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has not be
en heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his 
machine overhauled, I fancy."

"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the girl said."

"Undoubted
ly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing shoul
d stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship
. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preli
minary to starting for Eyford."

Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Read
ing to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Sco
tland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat an
d was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.

"There you are," said he. "That circle is
 drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten mi
les, I think, sir."

"It was an hour's good drive."

"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you 
were unconscious?"

"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewh
ere."

"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in 
the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."

"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a 
more inexorable face in my life."

"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I have drawn my cir
cle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."

"I think I cou
ld lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.

"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion! Com
e, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there."

"And I say eas
t," said my patient.

"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are several quiet little villages up th
ere."

"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice th
e carriage go up any."

"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxe
d the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"

"You are all wrong."

"But we can't all be."

"Oh, ye
s, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."


"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.

"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the ho
rse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"

"Indee
d, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature o
f this gang."

"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the 
amalgam which has taken the place of silver."

"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said the
 inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
 get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thank
s to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."

But the inspector was mistaken, for those crimi
nals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column o
f smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich fe
ather over the landscape.

"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.

"Yes, sir!
" said the station-master.

"When did it break out?"

"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse
, and the whole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becher's."

"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is D
r. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"

The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher i
s an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying
 with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do h
im no harm."

The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fir
e. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at
 every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames unde
r.

"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes wh
ere I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."

"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your reve
nge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire t
o the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep 
your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred mil
es off by now."

And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either 
of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart co
ntaining several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces o
f the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabout
s.

The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by
 discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts
 were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place bee
n reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machin
ery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored i
n an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have 
been already referred to.

How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovere
d his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. H
e had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large
 ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his comp
anion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.

"Well," said our engineer rueful
ly as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb an
d I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?"

"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may b
e of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the re
mainder of your existence."

X.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR


The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious t
ermination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom
 moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-ye
ar-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general publi
c, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him 
would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.

It was a few weeks before my own marriage, 
during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon strol
l to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden t
urn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic o
f my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had s
urrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all asid
e and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my
 friend's noble correspondent could be.

"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered. "Your mornin
g letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter."

"Yes, my correspondence has certainly th
e charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of 
those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."

He broke the seal and glanced 
over the contents.

"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."

"Not social, then?"

"No, disti
nctly professional."

"And from a noble client?"

"One of the highest in England."

"My dear fellow, I congratulate y
ou."

"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than 
the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. 
You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"

"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to
 a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."

"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to pos
t me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you h
ave followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"

"Oh, yes, with the d
eepest interest."

"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, a
nd in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:

"
 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and dis
cretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event whi
ch has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but h
e assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assista
nce. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope tha
t you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,


" 'ST. SIMON.'

"It is dated f
rom Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upo
n the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.

"He says four o'clock. It
 is three now. He will be here in an hour."

"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subj
ect. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our clie
nt is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said h
e, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. " 'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the D
uke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years o
f age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his fat
her, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on th
e distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for 
something more solid."

"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I, "for the facts are quite rece
nt, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry
 on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."

"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Sq
uare furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the res
ults of your newspaper selections."

"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the 
Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour i
s correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty
 Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."

"Terse and to the p
oint," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.

"There was a paragraph amplifying this in o
ne of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage 
market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the managem
ent of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An i
mportant addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these ch
arming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, h
as now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California 
millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festi
vities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, 
with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pi
ctures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor
, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the 
easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' "

"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.


"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quie
t one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, an
d that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Tw
o days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the
 honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared befo
re the disappearance of the bride."

"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.

"The vanishing of the lady."

"Wh
en did she vanish, then?"

"At the wedding breakfast."

"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; qui
te dramatic, in fact."

"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."

"They often vanish before the cerem
ony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me h
ave the details."

"I warn you that they are very incomplete."

"Perhaps we may make them less so."

"Such as they ar
e, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, 'S
ingular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':

" 'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greate
st consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The cerem
ony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it ha
s been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attemp
ts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can b
e served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.

" 'The ceremony, which was performed a
t St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius
 Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and siste
r of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius 
Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woma
n, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleg
ing that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected
 by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption,
 had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her 
prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only co
me up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the foot
men declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistr
ess, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in 
conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquir
ies are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late h
our last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul 
play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original di
sturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappe
arance of the bride.' "

"And is that all?"

"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a sugg
estive one."

"And it is--"

"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arre
sted. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some year
s. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the 
public press."

"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But the
re is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will 
prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a ch
eck to my own memory."

"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered,
 with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with t
he steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was b
risk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little 
bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edg
es and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-
coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the r
oom, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.


"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and collea
gue, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over."

"A most painful matter to me, as 
you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed se
veral delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society."

"No,
 I am descending."

"I beg pardon."

"My last client of the sort was a king."

"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which 
king?"

"The King of Scandinavia."

"What! Had he lost his wife?"

"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I
 extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours."

"Of course! Very right
! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you i
n forming an opinion."

"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume 
that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."

Lord St. Simon glan
ced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."

"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone coul
d offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."

"Pray do so."

"When di
d you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"

"In San Francisco, a year ago."

"You were travelling in the States?"

"Yes."

"
Did you become engaged then?"

"No."

"But you were on a friendly footing?"

"I was amused by her society, and she co
uld see that I was amused."

"Her father is very rich?"

"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."

"A
nd how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and cam
e up by leaps and bounds."

"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"

The no
bleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was 
twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods
 or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in E
ngland a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcani
c, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other 
hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had I no
t thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything
 dishonourable would be repugnant to her."

"Have you her photograph?"

"I brought this with me." He opened a locket 
and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist ha
d brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed 
long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.

"The young lady came to Lo
ndon, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"

"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met
 her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her."

"She brought, I understand, a considerable dow
ry?"

"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."

"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage 
is a fait accompli?"

"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."

"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran 
on the day before the wedding?"

"Yes."

"Was she in good spirits?"

"Never better. She kept talking of what we shoul
d do in our future lives."

"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?"

"She was as brigh
t as possible--at least until after the ceremony."

"And did you observe any change in her then?"

"Well, to tell the
 truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however
, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case."

"Pray let us have it, for all that."

"
Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time,
 and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, a
nd it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; a
nd in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"Indeed! You say that t
here was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?"

"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclu
de them when the church is open."

"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"

"No, no; I call him a gentle
man by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that w
e are wandering rather far from the point."

"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful fram
e of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?"

"I saw her in conversation wi
th her maid."

"And who is her maid?"

"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her."

"A
 confidential servant?"

"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties
. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way."

"How long did she speak to this Alic
e?"

"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."

"You did not overhear what they said?"

"Lady St. Simon 
said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant."


"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"

"S
he walked into the breakfast-room."

"On your arm?"

"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that
. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the
 room. She never came back."

"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her 
bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."

"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking int
o Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr
. Doran's house that morning."

"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations t
o her."

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly footing for some 
years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and 
she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing
, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was ab
out to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared 
lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured
 to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen 
the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her 
out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."

"Did your wife hear all this?"

"No, 
thank goodness, she did not."

"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"

"Yes. That is what Mr. Le
strade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrib
le trap for her."

"Well, it is a possible supposition."

"You think so, too?"

"I did not say a probable one. But yo
u do not yourself look upon this as likely?"

"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."

"Still, jealousy is a strange
 transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"

"Well, really, I came to seek a the
ory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred t
o me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, 
had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."

"In short, that she had become suddenly deran
ged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that man
y have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."

"Well, certainly that is also a co
nceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I 
ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"

"We could see the other
 side of the road and the Park."

"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicat
e with you."

"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.

"I have solved it."


"Eh? What was that?"

"I say that I have solved it."

"Where, then, is my wife?"

"That is a detail which I shall spe
edily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he rem
arked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my he
ad by putting it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and so
da and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came in
to the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which we
re quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is oc
casionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."

"But I have heard all
 that you have heard."

"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a p
arallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the 
Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find 
an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."

The official detective was attired in a pea-j
acket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With
 a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.

"What's up, then?" asked Holmes
 with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."

"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriag
e case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."

"Really! You surprise me."

"Who ever heard of such a mix
ed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."

"And very wet it seems
 to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpe
ntine."

"In heaven's name, what for?"

"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."

Sherlock Holmes leaned back in hi
s chair and laughed heartily.

"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he asked.

"Why? What do yo
u mean?"

"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other."

Lestrade shot an
 angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snarled.

"Well, I have only just heard the fact
s, but my mind is made up."

"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?"

"I think 
it very unlikely."

"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as h
e spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath
 and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile
. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the
 air. "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"

"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They h
ave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.
"

"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray w
hat did you hope to arrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."

"I a
m afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I am afraid
, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as 
many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."

"And how?"

"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is 
a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down upon the table in front of hi
m. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that
 Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her 
disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at t
he door and which lured her within their reach."

"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very 
fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and 
he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.

"Ha! you find it so?"

"Extremely so. I c
ongratulate you warmly."

Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking
 at the wrong side!"

"On the contrary, this is the right side."

"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note writt
en in pencil over here."

"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deepl
y."

"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. " 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cockta
il 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."

"Very likely not. It is most important, all the sa
me. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again."

"I've wasted t
ime enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Go
od-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thru
st them into the bag, and made for the door.

"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanis
hed; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has be
en, any such person."

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, 
shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his ove
rcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must
 leave you to your papers for a little."

It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time t
o be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with 
the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean lit
tle cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woo
dcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these lu
xuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things
 had been paid for and were ordered to this address.

Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into t
he room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been dis
appointed in his conclusions.

"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.

"You seem to expect co
mpany. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that 
Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."

It was indeed our vis
itor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed
 expression upon his aristocratic features.

"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

"Yes, and I confess tha
t the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?"

"The best possible."

Lord St.
 Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.

"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hear
s that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that th
ere is any humiliation."

"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."

"I fail to see that anyone is to b
lame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly 
to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis."

"It was a slight, sir, a public s
light," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.

"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed
 in so unprecedented a position."

"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used
."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to tak
e a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful." He opene
d the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. 
Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met."

At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung
 from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a
 picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still 
refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was har
d to resist.

"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every cause to be."

"Pray make no apology to
 me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken 
to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't know wha
t I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."

"Perhaps, Mr
s. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?"

"If I may give an opin
ion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my pa
rt, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven,
 with a sharp face and alert manner.

"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in 
'84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; b
ut then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and c
ame to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any lo
nger, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw m
e without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourse
lves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.
 So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'W
hy shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be you
r husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all rea
dy in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.


"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of h
im from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache India
ns, and there was my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa tho
ught I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that
 I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marria
ge was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
 in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done 
my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to
 make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the alta
r rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at 
first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I wer
e glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the cl
ergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a sc
ene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his
 lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. 
As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he ret
urned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I neve
r doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.

"Whe
n I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say no
thing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it wa
s dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwar
ds. I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He bec
koned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came 
talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little sec
ret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab to
gether, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all thos
e years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had gi
ven him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of m
y second wedding."

"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name and the church but not where the
 lady lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of i
t all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to Pa, perh
aps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that break
fast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so
 that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we shou
ld have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though 
how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank wa
s right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chan
ce of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have he
ard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me."

Lord 
St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to t
his long narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in t
his public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"

"Oh, certainly, if it would giv
e you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

"I had hoped," suggested
 Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."

"I think that there you ask a little too much," respo
nded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make m
erry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night." He included us all in a
 sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.

"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company," said S
herlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the foll
y of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day c
itizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and 
Stripes."

"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves 
to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplica
ble. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than th
e result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard."

"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?
"

"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the we
dding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had
 occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have
 spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If
 she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly
 have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change h
er plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have s
een an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a
 lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditio
ns. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change
 in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort t
o her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means takin
g possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had 
gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the lat
ter."

"And how in the world did you find them?"

"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information
 in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, bu
t more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hote
ls."

"How did you deduce the select?"

"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass o
f sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the 
second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, 
an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the ver
y items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I t
ravelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice 
and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer b
oth to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I ma
de him keep the appointment."

"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracio
us."

"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble o
f wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lor
d St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw
 your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak au
tumnal evenings."

XI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET


"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-windo
w looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to
 come out alone."

My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-go
wn, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep 
upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a b
rown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as whi
te as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there
 were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the 
single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and impo
sing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in bla
ck frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd cont
rast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a wea
ry man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggle
d his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.

"What on earth can be the matter with him?
" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the houses."

"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing
 his hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the sy
mptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell
 until the whole house resounded with the clanging.

A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still ges
ticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to ho
rror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who h
as been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against th
e wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes push
ed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing t
ones which he knew so well how to employ.

"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "You are 
fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into an
y little problem which you may submit to me."

The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting agains
t his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.

"N
o doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.

"God knows I ha
ve!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have fac
ed, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
 but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not 
I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair."

"Pray compos
e yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you."


"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of 
Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."

The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner
 in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of
 the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he b
raced himself to tell his story.

"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when the poli
ce inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried 
from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who 
takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I
 can.

"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able
 to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositor
s. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable.
 We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we h
ave advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.

"Yesterday morning I was seated in
 my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it w
as that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a hou
sehold word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the 
honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wish
es to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

" 'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the 
habit of advancing money.'

" 'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.

" 'It is absolutely essentia
l to me,' said he, 'that I should have $50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over f
rom my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my positi
on you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'

" 'For how long, may I ask, 
do you want this sum?' I asked.

" 'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay w
hat you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money s
hould be paid at once.'

" 'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said I
, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the n
ame of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution s
hould be taken.'

" 'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he h
ad laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'

" 'One of the most precious public posses
sions of the empire,' said I.

" 'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet,
 lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and th
e price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum
 which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'

"I took the precious case into my hands and
 looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

" 'You doubt its value?' he asked.

" 'Not at all. I on
ly doubt--'

" 'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing
 so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is 
the security sufficient?'

" 'Ample.'

" 'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the conf
idence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
 refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution beca
use I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would 
be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impos
sible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Mond
ay morning.'

"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him 
to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in fr
ont of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There 
could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occu
r to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter
 now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.

"When evening came I felt that it would 
be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and
 why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, there
fore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never b
e really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the je
wel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.


"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and 
my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a n
umber of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, 
has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me sati
sfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is th
e only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

"So much f
or the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have a
n only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I
 am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that h
e was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied 
him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.

"It wa
s naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wa
yward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he be
came a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of me
n with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until
 he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle 
his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each 
time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.

"And, indeed, I could not 
wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to
 my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur,
 a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man o
f great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convi
nced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrus
ted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.

"And now there 
is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world
 I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beau
tiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right h
and. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy 
has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone cou
ld have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life
; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and
 I shall continue with my miserable story.

"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, 
I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the 
name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that t
he door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it bette
r not to disturb it.

" 'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.

" 'In my own bureau.'

" 'Well, I hope to goodness th
e house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.

" 'It is locked up,' I answered.

" 'Oh, any old key will fit t
hat bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'

"He often had a w
ild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a v
ery grave face.

" 'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let me have $200?'

" 'No, I cannot!' 
I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.'

" 'You have been very kind,' said he, 
'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'

" 'And a very good thing, too!
' I cried.

" 'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I
 must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.'

"I was very ang
ry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which he bow
ed and left the room without another word.

"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was sa
fe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leav
e to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at t
he side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.

" 'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I th
ought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'

" 'Certainly not.'

" 'She came 
in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think tha
t it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'

" 'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are
 you sure that everything is fastened?'

" 'Quite sure, dad.'

" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my b
edroom again, where I was soon asleep.

"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bea
ring upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."

"On the contrary,
 your statement is singularly lucid."

"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so
. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. Abo
ut two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it ha
d left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Sudd
enly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all
 palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.

" 'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! 
you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'

"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed onl
y in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenc
hing at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. 
I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.

" 'You black
guard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the je
wels which you have stolen?'

" 'Stolen!' he cried.

" 'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

" 'There
 are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.

" 'There are three missing. And you know where they are. M
ust I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'

" 'You have called me
 names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you
 have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.'

" 'You shall le
ave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to the bot
tom.'

" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his natur
e. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'

"By this time the whole house was astir, f
or I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and o
f Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-mai
d for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the h
ouse, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with th
eft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was 
national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.

" 'At least,' said he, 'you will
 not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minu
tes.'

" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then, realising t
he dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who wa
s far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He migh
t avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.

" 'You may as well face the m
atter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but ma
ke such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'

" 
'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was t
oo hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave 
him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house 
where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open
 his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through
 all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. Th
e police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
 necessary. I have already offered a reward of $1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my
 son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, dro
ning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with
 his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.

"None save my partner
 with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else
, I think."

"Do you go out much in society?"

"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it."


"That is unusual in a young girl."

"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-tw
enty."

"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also."

"Terrible! She is even more affect
ed than I."

"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"

"How can we have when I saw him with my own
 eyes with the coronet in his hands."

"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet a
t all injured?"

"Yes, it was twisted."

"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?"


"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at
 all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"

"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent
 a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the po
lice think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"

"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closi
ng his bedroom door."

"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. Wha
t did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"

"They are still sounding the planking and probing the fur
niture in the hope of finding them."

"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"

"Yes, they have shown extrao
rdinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined."

"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not ob
vious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first incline
d to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by 
your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened you
r bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, conceal
ed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thi
rty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such 
a theory tenable?"

"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were innoc
ent, why does he not explain them?"

"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. H
older, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."

M
y friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and
 sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker's son app
eared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I f
elt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly 
spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over h
is eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope whi
ch had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short rail
way journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.

Fairbank was a g
ood-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-cla
d lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wood
en thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and fo
rming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the ground
s at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all
 round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane
. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We we
re sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, sl
im, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I h
ave ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with c
rying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in
 the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capa
city for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head w
ith a sweet womanly caress.

"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked.


"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."

"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what wom
an's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."

"Why is
 he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."

"Ho
w could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"

"Oh, but he had only picked it
 up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so 
dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"

"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Y
our affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought
 a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."

"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"No
, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now."

"The stable lane?" She raised he
r dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in 
proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."

"I fully share your opinio
n, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his sh
oes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"

"Pray do, sir,
 if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."

"You heard nothing yourself last night?"

"Nothing, until my uncl
e here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down."

"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. D
id you fasten all the windows?"

"Yes."

"Were they all fastened this morning?"

"Yes."

"You have a maid who has a s
weetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"

"Yes, and she was t
he girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."

"I see. You infer
 that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."

"But what is the
 good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the co
ronet in his hands?"

"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw he
r return by the kitchen door, I presume?"

"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her 
slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"Do you know him?"

"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our 
vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."

"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, f
arther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"

"Yes, he did."

"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"

Somet
hing like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do
 you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin, eager face.

"I should be very glad no
w to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better ta
ke a look at the lower windows before I go up."

He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the l
arge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the s
ill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.

The banker's dressing-room was a
 plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau f
irst and looked hard at the lock.

"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.

"That which my son himself indicated--
that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."

"Have you it here?"

"That is it on the dressing-table."

Sherlock Holmes 
took it up and opened the bureau.

"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This
 case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he 
laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the fines
t that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been to
rn away.

"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunate
ly lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."

The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying," sai
d he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a little," said 
he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man 
could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pis
tol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"

"I
 do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."

"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Mis
s Holder?"

"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."

"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw
 him?"

"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."

"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extra
ordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter 
up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."

He went alone, at his own req
uest, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was 
at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.

"I think that I ha
ve seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my rooms."

"But th
e gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"

"I cannot tell."

The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" h
e cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"

"My opinion is in no way altered."

"Then, for God's sake, what was this d
ark business which was acted in my house last night?"

"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow mo
rning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte 
blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw."


"I would give my fortune to have them back."

"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-by
e; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening."

It was obvious to me that my compani
on's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine
. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to s
ome other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms o
nce more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar t
urned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.

"I think 
that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,
 Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp,
 but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint 
upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he starte
d off upon his expedition.

I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an 
old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.

"I only loo
ked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."

"Where to?"

"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be 
some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be late."

"How are you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. 
Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a v
ery sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but
 must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self."

I could see by his manner that h
e had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a tou
ch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door,
 which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of 
his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he w
as hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I ca
me down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fres
h and trim as possible.

"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but you remember that our clie
nt has rather an early appointment this morning."

"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be surprise
d if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."

It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change 
which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in
, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more p
ainful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for h
im.

"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prospero
us man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the h
eels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."

"Deserted you?"

"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in
, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in a
nger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. I
t is to that remark that she refers in this note:

" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
 and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought 
in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my futu
re, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-servic
e to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving


" 'MARY.'

"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do yo
u think it points to suicide?"

"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. 
Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."

"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you h
ave learned something! Where are the gems?"

"You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?"

"I would 
pay ten."

"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. H
ave you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000."

With a dazed face the banker made out the req
uired check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and th
rew it down upon the table.

With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! 
I am saved!"

The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bo
som.

"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.

"Owe!" He caught up a pen
. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."

"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, yo
ur son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to hav
e one."

"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"

"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."

"You
 are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known."

"He knows it already. Wh
en I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to
 him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to m
e. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips."

"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordi
nary mystery!"

"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, tha
t which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell 
and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."

"My Mary? Impossible!"

"It is unfortunately more than possible; 
it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family ci
rcle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man withou
t heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hun
dred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but a
t least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening."

"I cannot, and I will not, bel
ieve it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your 
niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
 leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told h
im of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that sh
e loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must 
have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed th
e window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfect
ly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness
 about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, w
as surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-roo
m. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come o
f this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw t
hat she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran alo
ng and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her ste
althily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to he
r room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

"As long as she was on the scene he could not 
take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised
 how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just 
as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a
 dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle
 between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son s
truck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the cor
onet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had 
been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene."

"Is it possibl
e?" gasped the banker.

"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved
 your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved lit
tle enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret."

"And th
at was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I hav
e been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece w
ere at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"

"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes
, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew
 that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. 
I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, a
t the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side show
ed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to th
e door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone aw
ay. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and i
nquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to b
e the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of m
e.

"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to
 a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had
 walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the bo
ot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, wher
e Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more d
own the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, 
finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane,
 and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the othe
r end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.

"On entering the house, however
, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that s
omeone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. 
I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; some
one had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; t
hey had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. H
e had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question
 now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?

"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have exc
luded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who ha
d brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son all
ow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there wa
s an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I r
emembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture be
came a certainty.

"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the l
ove and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a 
very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation
 among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthu
r had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compr
omising his own family.

"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a 
loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his 
head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off 
shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."

"I saw an ill-dressed 
vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.

"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came
 home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be a
voided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went
 and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he t
ried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his h
ead before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for th
e stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said
 he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them,
 on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at
 $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'
clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."

"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,"
 said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you h
ave done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise 
to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even y
our skill can inform me where she is now."

"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever 
Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than su
fficient punishment."

XII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES


"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remar
ked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least imp
ortant and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watso
n, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough 
to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many caus
es celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial 
in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made 
my special province."

"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationa
lism which has been urged against my records."

"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder wi
th the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a dispu
tatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
 statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effe
ct which is really the only notable feature about the thing."

"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in t
he matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to b
e a strong factor in my friend's singular character.

"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as 
was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersona
l thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the c
rime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."

It
 was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room a
t Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed lik
e dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of
 china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping co
ntinuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his sea
rch, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.

"At the same time," he rema
rked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly b
e open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, 
a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help 
the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twi
sted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoi
ding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."

"The end may have been so," I answered, "bu
t the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest."

"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unob
servant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer s
hades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases
 are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it s
eems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardi
ng-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I 
fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.

It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding eveni
ng, and ran thus:

"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a 
situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenienc
e you. Yours faithfully,


"VIOLET HUNTER."

"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.

"Not I."

"It is half-past ten n
ow."

"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."

"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remem
ber that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious invest
igation. It may be so in this case, also."

"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,
 unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."

As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the roo
m. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk ma
nner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.

"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said sh
e, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relation
s of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should 
do."

"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you."

I could see that Hol
mes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,
 and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.

"I have bee
n a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel recei
ved an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself
 without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money whic
h I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.

"There is a well-known agency fo
r governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether a
nything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really man
aged by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom
, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit 
them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was n
ot alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fol
d over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who enter
ed. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.

" 'That will do,' said he; 'I 
could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in t
he most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.

" 'You ar
e looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

" 'Yes, sir.'

" 'As governess?'

" 'Yes, sir.'

" 'And what salary do y
ou ask?'

" 'I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.'

" 'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!
' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer s
o pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?'

" 'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than y
ou imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'

" 'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all q
uite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in
 a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part
 in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept an
ything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'

"You may imagine, Mr. Ho
lmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing
 perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.

" 'It is also my custom,' s
aid he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases
 of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses 
of their journey and their wardrobe.'

"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. 
As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural 
about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.

" 'May I ask w
here you live, sir?' said I.

" 'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of W
inchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'

" 'And my duties, 
sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'

" 'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if y
ou could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leane
d back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.

"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's 
amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.

" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'a
re to take charge of a single child?'

" 'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your du
ty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided alw
ays that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'

" 'I should be ha
ppy to make myself useful.'

" 'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-he
arted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?'

"
 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.

" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to
 you?'

" 'Oh, no.'

" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'

"I could hardly believe my ears. As 
you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been co
nsidered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.

" 'I am afraid that that is quite im
possible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face
 as I spoke.

" 'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fa
ncies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your hair?'

" 'No, sir, I really cou
ld not,' I answered firmly.

" 'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other res
pects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young 
ladies.'

"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced
 at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commiss
ion through my refusal.

" 'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.

" 'If you please, Miss St
oper.'

" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,' said s
he sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss 
Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my
 lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself wheth
er I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the mos
t extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are 
getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I 
should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was su
re of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still o
pen when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:


" 'The Copper
 Beeches, near Winchester.

" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from
 here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she h
as been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recom
pense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife i
s fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You nee
d not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Phila
delphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in a
ny manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as
 I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this 
point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is
 concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know you
r train. Yours faithfully,


" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'

"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my
 mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit
 the whole matter to your consideration."

"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," s
aid Holmes, smiling.

"But you would not advise me to refuse?"

"I confess that it is not the situation which I shoul
d like to see a sister of mine apply for."

"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"

"Ah, I have no data. I cann
ot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"

"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. 
Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desir
es to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way i
n order to prevent an outbreak?"

"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable on
e. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."

"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!
"

"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a yea
r, when they could have their pick for $40? There must be some strong reason behind."

"I thought that if I told you 
the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt tha
t you were at the back of me."

"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem 
promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about 
some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"

"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"

Ho
lmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or
 night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anx
iety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle 
at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes sh
e bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descend
ing the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."

"And she would need to
 be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."

It was not ver
y long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts 
turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into
. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a f
ad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As t
o Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he
 swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can'
t make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have acce
pted such a situation.

The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turni
ng in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, whe
n I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came dow
n to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to m
e.

"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.

The summons was a brief
 and urgent one.

"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at m
y wit's end.


"HUNTER."

"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up,
 then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."


"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at 
our best in the morning."

By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holme
s had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them 
down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white 
clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in
 the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, 
the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.

"Are th
ey not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.

But Holme
s shook his head gravely.

"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like m
ine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and 
you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isola
tion and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."

"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate cri
me with these dear old homesteads?"

"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upo
n my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does t
he smiling and beautiful countryside."

"You horrify me!"

"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public op
inion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child
, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole 
machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the 
crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignor
ant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, ye
ar in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winches
ter, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is cle
ar that she is not personally threatened."

"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."

"Quite 
so. She has her freedom."

"What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"

"I have devised seven sep
arate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can onl
y be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the
 cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell."

The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the Hig
h Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sittin
g-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.

"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It is 
so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.
"

"Pray tell us what has happened to you."

"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to 
be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."

"Let 
us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to l
isten.

"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. 
Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.
"

"What can you not understand?"

"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. W
hen I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beau
tifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all 
stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a
 field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. Th
is ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of 
copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.

"I was driven over by my emplo
yer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth
, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not
 mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should thi
nk, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married 
about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to 
Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning a
version to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her positio
n must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.

"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as
 well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see tha
t she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually fr
om one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, 
boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman
. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her i
n tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have ne
ver met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite 
disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and glo
omy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and 
he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not t
alk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story."

"I am glad of all details," rem
arked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or not."

"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. 
The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. Th
ere are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and w
hiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucas
tle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Ruca
stle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery
 and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.

"For two days after my arrival at the 
Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered somet
hing to her husband.

" 'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling
 in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your a
ppearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in yo
ur room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.'

"The dress which I found 
waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakab
le signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and 
Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiti
ng for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three
 long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned t
owards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, bega
n to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, an
d I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as s
miled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle su
ddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little
 Edward in the nursery.

"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. 
Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which 
my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and mov
ing my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I
 read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he 
ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the
 meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my f
ace away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first
 it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me
, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put m
y handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess th
at I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I per
ceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be lo
oking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was l
eaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glan
ced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced 
that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.

" 'Jephro,' s
aid she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'

" 'No friend of yours, M
iss Hunter?' he asked.

" 'No, I know no one in these parts.'

" 'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round an
d motion to him to go away.'

" 'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'

" 'No, no, we should have him loiteri
ng here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'

"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. R
ucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I w
orn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."

"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a mo
st interesting one."

"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation betwee
n the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took
 me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain
, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.

" 'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between tw
o planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'

"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddl
ed up in the darkness.

" 'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. 'It's onl
y Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. 
We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every n
ight, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set y
our foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is worth.'

"The warning was no idle one, for two
 nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonli
ght night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in 
the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. 
As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hangin
g jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon t
he other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.


"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had pla
ced it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by
 examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the
 room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I ha
d still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it mig
ht have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fi
tted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never gu
ess what it was. It was my coil of hair.

"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the sa
me thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in 
the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I l
aid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would,
 I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the m
atter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.

"I am
 naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in m
y head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led int
o the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended t
he stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made hi
m a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all cr
inkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me withou
t a word or a look.

"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strol
led round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row,
 three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled
 up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.

" 'Ah
!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with bu
siness matters.'

"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of sp
are rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'

"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little sta
rtled at my remark.

" 'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me!
 what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?' He spo
ke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but
 no jest.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms wh
ich I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. 
It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of wo
man's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keen
ly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.

"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell
 you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once sa
w him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday e
vening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had 
left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable op
portunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.

"There was a little passage in
 front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were thre
e doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, wit
h two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them
. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, pa
dlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as we
ll, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I
 could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let
 in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, 
I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little sli
t of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes.
 My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutc
hing at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastl
e, who was waiting outside.

" 'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the do
or open.'

" 'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.

" 'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how c
aressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?'

"But his voice was just a l
ittle too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.

" 'I was foolish enough to go into the empty
 wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it 
is so dreadfully still in there!'

" 'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.

" 'Why, what did you think?' I aske
d.

" 'Why do you think that I lock this door?'

" 'I am sure that I do not know.'

" 'It is to keep people out who h
ave no business there. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.

" 'I am sure if I had known--'


" 'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile 
hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'

"I
 was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember 
nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live 
there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of t
he child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled
 from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire
. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, f
eeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but
 I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the on
ly one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipp
ed in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting l
eave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are goi
ng on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adve
ntures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should d
o."

Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the r
oom, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.

"Is Toller still drunk?
" he asked.

"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him."

"That is well. And the R
ucastles go out to-night?"

"Yes."

"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"

"Yes, the wine-cellar."

"You seem 
to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you c
ould perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman."

"I will tr
y. What is it?"

"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by 
that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you c
ould send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.
"

"I will do it."

"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible e
xplanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That
 is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember 
right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the
 colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of c
ourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoub
tedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he w
as convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfec
tly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavour
ing to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the ch
ild."

"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.

"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually g
aining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally 
valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This 
child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling fath
er, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power."

"I am sure that
 you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have
 hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature."

"We must be circumspect, for we are
 dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it wi
ll not be long before we solve the mystery."

We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the 
Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining 
like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
 standing smiling on the door-step.

"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.

A loud thudding noise came from somewhere 
downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his
 keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's."

"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now 
lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."

We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, foll
owed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the
 cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came 
from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.

"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Mi
ss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we ca
nnot make our way in."

It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed in
to the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. 
The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.

"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty h
as guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off."

"But how?"

"Through the skylight. We shall soo
n see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light lad
der against the eaves. That is how he did it."

"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not there w
hen the Rucastles went away."

"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I sho
uld not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would b
e as well for you to have your pistol ready."

The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the do
or of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the
 wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.

"You villain!" said he, "where's y
our daughter?"

The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.

"It is for me to ask you that," h
e shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll serve you!" He turn
ed and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.

"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.

"I have my rev
olver," said I.

"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hard
ly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound w
hich it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side doo
r.

"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too la
te!"

Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge fa
mished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up
, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. W
ith much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the 
drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relie
ve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.

"Mrs. T
oller!" cried Miss Hunter.

"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss,
 it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted."


"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone els
e."

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."

"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for ther
e are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."

"I will soon make it clear to you," said 
she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's police-court business over t
his, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.

"She was nev
er happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no sa
y in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as 
I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never sa
id a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there w
as a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought i
t time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money
. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. 
Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no chang
e in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."

"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have bee
n good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I 
presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"

"Yes, sir."

"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to ge
t rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."

"That was it, sir."

"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, 
as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or other
wise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his."

"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed g
entleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.

"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, a
nd that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."

"You have it, sir, just as it happene
d."

"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up everything which
 puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss H
unter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one."

And thus was so
lved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was a
lways a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, 
who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss R
ucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a go
vernment appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointm
ent, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she 
is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, 
a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searc
hed and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If th
e value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we relea
se over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to try
ing for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over hal
f a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This 
is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,

PREFACE


As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in
our public schools embraces three d
istinct treatments of the subject.
Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which
is usually 
a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the sev
enth or eighth
grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the
addition of forty or fifty thous
and words. Finally, there is the high
school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving
fuller acc
ounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we
do not assume that our children obtain permanent posse
ssions from their
study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the
same method, high school texts
 on algebra and geometry would include the
multiplication table and fractions.

There is, of course, a ready answer t
o the criticism advanced above. It
is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
their pupi
ls retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of
history will deny this. Still it is a standing challeng
e to existing
methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be
made truly progressive like the st
udy of mathematics, science, and
languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
their subject
 to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive
historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first tex
t--more
facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp
criticism which it is receiving from t
eachers of science, civics, and
economics.

In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
new
 high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one
of omission. The time-honored stories of explora
tion and the
biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know
little or nothing about Columbu
s, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John
Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the
same sto
ries for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It
is an offense against the teachers of those subjects t
hat are
demonstrated to be progressive in character.

In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. 
Our
reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single
battle is a highly technical, and usually 
a highly controversial, matter
about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval
operations most 
writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To
dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten page
s is
equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who
compares the ordinary textbook account of
 a single Civil War campaign
with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further
comment. No youth
 called upon to serve our country in arms would think
of turning to a high school manual for information about the ar
t of
warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the
interest of the immature pupil, seems out of p
lace in a book that
deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's
serious responsibilities.


It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is
rather upon constructive features.

_First._
 We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have
tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and
 movements of
each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.

_Second._ We have emphasized tho
se historical topics which help to
explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.

_Third._ We have dwelt f
ully upon the social and economic aspects of our
history, especially in relation to the politics of each period.

_Fo
urth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems
of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather 
than military strategy.
These are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These
are matters which civil
ians can understand--matters which they must
understand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.

_Fift
h._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to
enlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given 
special attention
to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
matter of sound instruction i
n citizenship.

_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique
characteristics, is a part of a gene
ral civilization. Accordingly we
have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the
reciprocal influence
s of nations their appropriate place.

_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The
study of a
 mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We
have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, as
sociation,
reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as
inform the mind. We have been at g
reat pains to make our text clear,
simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
intellects of our 
readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them
will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high sc
hool.
The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will
depend upon the possession of other powe
rs than memory alone. The
effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
the excellence of th
eir judgment as well as the fullness of their
information.

HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES




PART I. THE COLONIAL PERIOD




CHAPTE
R I

THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA


The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America
during the
 early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the su
rface of the
earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,
westward as far as Gaul, across t
he Mediterranean, and eastward into
Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported
by their
 armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the
narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heat
her of Scotland to
the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the
Danube and the Rhine, poured 
into the empire of the Caesars and made the
beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires
the
 settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only
one aspect of the expansion which finally carrie
d the peoples, the
institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.

In one vital point, it must 
be noted, American colonization differed
from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them
affection fo
r the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants 
who came to
America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
country. They established compacts of go
vernment for themselves and set
up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also
political and 
religious liberty for themselves and their children.


THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION

It was no light matter 
for the English to cross three thousand miles of
water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of t
he
seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays
of money. Stores had to be furnished in qu
antities sufficient to sustain
the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.
Artisans and l
aborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defe
nse and
mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,
adept in managing men, had to be dis
covered. Altogether such an
enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
gentleman could amass an
d involved risks more imminent than he dared to
assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, weal
thy
proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was
the corporation that furnished the capit
al and leadership in the
beginning.

=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an
instrument for 
colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which
had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign 
countries.
Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
society--noblemen, merchants, and ge
ntlemen--who banded together for a
particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
the profit
s of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it
received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading
 privileges from
the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
control. The charter named all the 
persons originally included in the
corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its
affairs, includi
ng the right to admit new members. The company was in
fact a little government set up by the king. When the members o
f the
corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,
they operated through agents sent to t
he colony. When they came over the
seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,
they beca
me the direct government of the country they possessed. The
stockholders in that instance became the voters and the g
overnor, the
chief magistrate.

[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY
COMPANY]

Four of the
 thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the
trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by Ki
ng James I,
in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia
at Jamestown. It was under the a
uspices of their West India Company,
chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New
Netherland 
in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts
were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles 
I incorporated
in 1629 under the title: "The governor and company of the Massachusetts
Bay in New England." In this c
ase the law did but incorporate a group
drawn together by religious ties. "We must be knit together as one man,"
wrot
e John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the
south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedi
sh commercial company
in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it
was destined to pass und
er the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the
rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.

In a cer
tain sense, Georgia may be included among the "company
colonies." It was, however, originally conceived by the moving
 spirit,
James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned
for debt. To realize this humane pu
rpose, he secured from King George
II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including
himself, into "o
ne body politic and corporate," known as the "Trustees
for establishing the colony of Georgia in America." In the str
ucture of
their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not
differ materially from the regular
 companies created for trade and
colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions
had to be un
der the forms of law and according to the rules of business.

=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which fi
gured largely in
the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or
congregation, of men and women brought t
ogether in the bonds of a common
religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this
institution, founde
d in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a
potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a lan
d far
away from Galilee. "And the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one soul," we are told in 
the Acts describing the Church at
Jerusalem. "We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
the Lord ..
. by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
care of each other's good and of the whole," wrote John R
obinson, a
leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in
1620. The Mayflower Compact, so fam
ous in American history, was but a
written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to
the common 
good, which served as a guide to self-government until
Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.

 THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]

Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve
of the American Revol
ution, likewise sprang directly from the
congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New
Hampshire,
 mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by
small bodies of men and women, "united in solemn covenants
 with the
Lord," who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a
year after Roger Williams and Anne
 Hutchinson conducted their followers
to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of
incorporation
 (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation
of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Con
necticut River
Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own
(1662) and a place among the colo
nies. Half a century elapsed before the
towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts
were
 formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.

Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sea
ling wax of
the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government
and obedience to law previously es
tablished by the congregations. The
towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily
under their "
Fundamental Orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had
the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their "Fu
ndamental
Articles" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut
shore had no difficulty in agreeing tha
t "the Scriptures do hold forth a
perfect rule for the direction and government of all men."

=The Proprietor.=--A th
ird and very important colonial agency was the
proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word
"pro
perty," implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king
granted property in lands in North America to have, hol
d, use, and enjoy
for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down
to his heirs in perpetual su
ccession. The proprietor was a rich and
powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the
ships
, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found
and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes
 the proprietor
worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
common undertaking.

Five co
lonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,
owe their formal origins, though not always their firs
t settlements, nor
in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,
established in 1634 under a C
atholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and
blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under
the mild
 rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American
union. New Jersey, beginning its career under two propri
etors, Berkeley
and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown
in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in 
a very large measure, the product of the
generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader
of t
he Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolina
s were first
organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of
eight proprietors, including Lord 
Clarendon; but after more than half a
century both became royal provinces governed by the king.

AM PENN, PROPRIETOR OF PENNSYLVANIA]


THE COLONIAL PEOPLES

=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen co
lonies, except
New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save
these two, the main, if not th
e sole, current of immigration was from
England. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,
women, an
d children of "all sorts and conditions." The major portion
were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and art
isans. With
them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
their fortunes to the New World. S
cholars came from Oxford and
Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an
English nobleman 
left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
America. The people represented every religious faith--members of
 the
Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that
church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friend
s, who had left it altogether;
and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.

New England was almost pur
ely English. During the years between 1629 and
1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand

Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far
North. Although minor additions were made from ti
me to time, the greater
portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.
Virginia, too, for a long 
time drew nearly all her immigrants from
England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other
nationalities, 
mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in
numbers.

The populations of later English colonies--the Ca
rolinas, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of
immigration from England, were const
antly augmented by wanderers from
the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England
in such nu
mbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that
"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church." N
orth Carolina was
first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.
Some of the North Carolinians
, particularly the Quakers, came all the
way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how
lit
tle they were wanted in that Anglican colony.

=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were

the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both
religious and economic reasons sent them across t
he sea. Their Scotch
ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland
whence the native Irish 
had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There
the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form 
of
religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the 
end of the seventeenth
century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of
their cloth was forbid
den by the English Parliament. Within two decades
twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and al
l
during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.
Although no exact record was kept, it is reckone
d that the Scotch-Irish
and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of
the entire American pop
ulation on the eve of the Revolution.

[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH
IMMIGRANTS]

These newco
mers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming l
ate upon
the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
already taken up. For this reason most 
of them became frontier people
settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,
laid out their 
small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the soil,"
hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neithe
r the
luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
merchants. To their agriculture they added woo
len and linen
manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
women, made heavy inroads upon
 the trade of the English merchants in
the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:

        "O, willing hands to t
oil;
    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;
    Bold pioneers for the wilderness,
 defenders in the field."

=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical
importance were the German
s. From the very beginning, they appeared in
colonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
J
amestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous
governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel 
on the Rhine, and
Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
administration of New York, was 
a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The
wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.
Penn was
 diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants fr
om the Rhine
country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought
more than twenty thousand acres fro
m him and in 1684 established a
center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old
New York, Rhin
ebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for
distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offe
red
to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in
time, German settlements. In fact the migra
tion became so large that
German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
England was alarmed by t
he influx of foreigners into her overseas
dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the
colonial 
period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two
hundred thousand.

The majority of them were Protestants fro
m the Rhine region, and South
Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove
them forth to Ame
rica. Though most of them were farmers, there were also
among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid grow
th of
industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,
dotted here and there among the thickly
 settled regions, added to the
wealth and independence of the province.

A GLIMPS
E OF OLD GERMANTOWN]

Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the
original colonists or mi
ngle freely with them. They kept to themselves,
built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published

their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
and led to occasional agitations against "fore
igners." However, no
serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the
Revolution, German soldiers fro
m Pennsylvania fought in the patriot
armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish
sections.

=
Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the
Germans made up the bulk of the colonial populat
ion, there were other
racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing
their share to colonia
l life.

From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
inflicted terrible penalties upon P
rotestants.

From "Old Ireland" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and
Catholic in religion. Like their S
cotch-Irish neighbors to the north,
they revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed
upon them b
y the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping
records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatl
oad left
the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.
Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were
 Irish of the native
stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
Celtic names in the records 
of various colonies.

[Illustration:_From an old print_

OLD DUTCH FORT AND ENGLISH CHURCH NEAR ALBANY]

The Jews, th
en as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious
and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, no
t complete
liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,
France, Spain, or Portugal. The English 
law did not actually recognize
their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going
habits of the
 Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occa
sion the
mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on
another prohibited the exercise of their
 religious worship. Newport,
Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large
Jewish colonies, cons
isting principally of merchants and their families,
flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.

Though t
he small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged
beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New Yor
k continued
to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English
conquest in 1664. At the end of the col
onial period over one-half of the
170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original
Dutch--still d
istinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
manners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their
 mother
tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;
but they were slowly losing their iden
tity as the English pressed in
beside them to farm and trade.

The melting pot had begun its historic mission.


THE 
PROCESS OF COLONIZATION

Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the
emigrants, was an econom
ic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay
for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them 
on
the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,
Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike la
id.

=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America
in colonial days were capitalists themse
lves, in a small or a large way,
and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able
to finance th
eir voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.
Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we 
can trace the
family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority
for the statement that "the sett
lers of New England were drawn from the
country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother
country.... Many
 of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists
show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of proper
ty and
good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration
is usually supplied, for they all had 
a stake in the country they left
behind." Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this
statement is or ho
w applicable to the other colonies, no study has as
yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an

unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
cost of their own transfer to the New World.

=
Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants
were unable to pay for their passage is establis
hed beyond the shadow of
a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great
barrier in the way of t
he poor who wanted to go to America was the cost
of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out

whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
money to immigrants in return for their promise,
 or bond, to work for a
term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called
indentured servitude.

It is 
probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia ge
ntlemen, and the
Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to
Georgia were to be found in the
 fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
five t
o seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Cart
erets, and other
promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
their fields, for land without l
abor was worth no more than land in the
moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.
Every
 inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,
and special efforts were made to increase the popula
tion by importing
servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with
fifty bond servants on his est
ate. It has been estimated that two-thirds
of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the
eightee
nth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.
In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless
 not so large; but
it formed a considerable part of the population.

The story of this traffic in white servants is o
ne of the most striking
things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the
feudal age in that the
y were not bound to the soil but to the master.
They likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude 
had
a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It
was, for instance, a common practice to im
pose on them penalties far
heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free
citizen of Pennsylvani
a who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful cond
uct
was whipped at the post and fined as well.

The ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. 
A
bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in
trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an 
attempt to escape or
indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.
The condition of white b
ondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, "was
little better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put
t
hem at the mercy of their masters." It would not be unfair to add that
such was their lot in all other colonies. Thei
r fate depended upon the
temper of their masters.

Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people 
in the
Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate
for freedom and a home of their own. 
When their weary years of servitude
were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or
settle as fre
e mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble
proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable
 to rise
out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
carried him. For thousands, on the contr
ary, bondage proved to be a real
avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America
have the bloo
d of indentured servants in their veins.

=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure
settl
ers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America
either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidna
pping men, women,
and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was
officially estimated that "ten thou
sand persons were spirited away" to
America. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for
the traffic
 in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were
sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling t
o support them.
In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
Virginia.

In this gruesome bu
siness there lurked many tragedies, and very few
romances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands fr
om
their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and
weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up
 by death. A few thus
dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of
five or seven years later 
became prosperous and returned home with
fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
live
d to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a
peerage.

Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic 
position, were convicts
deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The
Americans protested 
vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.
Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the "criminals" w
ere
only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant
caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or
 a luckless servant girl
who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
sturdy thieves and 
incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders
were "political criminals"; that is, persons who criticized or oppo
sed
the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against
British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who cha
mpioned the king against
the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the
monarchy was restored; a
nd Scotch and English subjects in general who
joined in political uprisings against the king.

=The African Slaves.=-
-Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
indentured servants and whites carried to America against their will

were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When
this form of bondage was first introduced in
to Virginia in 1619, it was
looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase
of the white popul
ation. Moreover it does not appear that those planters
who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to esta
blish a
system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery
take firm root and become recognized 
as the leading source of the labor
supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there
were only t
hree hundred Africans in Virginia.

The great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the
inordinate z
eal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in
New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroe
s in Africa,
they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal
African Company sent to America an
nually between 1713 and 1743 from five
to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far
behind the
ir English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.

As the proportion of the negroes to the free white popula
tion steadily
rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,
the Southern colonies grew alar
med. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail
the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was
futil
e, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time
similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal di
sapproval. South
Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure
was killed by the British crow
n. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted
by a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:
"The i
mportation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa
hath long been considered as a trade of great inhuman
ity and under its
present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger
the very existence of Your Ma
jesty's American dominions.... Deeply
impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to
remove 
all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony
which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might c
heck so very
pernicious a commerce."

All such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps
and bo
unds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than
half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia,
 the two Carolinas,
and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
in number. In South Carol
ina they formed almost two-thirds of the
population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania
about o
ne-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the
proportion of slaves steadily diminished although cha
ttel servitude was
on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one
in six and in New England
 one in fifty were negroes, including a few
freedmen.

The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the N
orth were
all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,
though sectional, was a part of the 
national system of economy. Northern
ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the
plantations
 to Europe. "If the Northern states will consult their
interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which wi
ll
increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers," said
John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the co
nvention which framed the
Constitution of the United States. "What enriches a part enriches the
whole and the states 
are the best judges of their particular interest,"
responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connect
icut.

CHAPTER II

COLONIAL AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, AND COMMERCE

THE 
LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT


=The Significance of Land Tenure.=--The way in which land may be
acquired, held, div
ided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
deep influence on the life and culture of a people. The feudal and

aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism
which was characterized by two distinct feat
ures. In the first place,
the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single
proprietor. In the se
cond place, every estate was kept intact under the
law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all
 his
landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of
estates and the growth of a large body of s
mall farmers or freeholders
owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude
inevitable for the mass of
 those who labored on the land. It also
enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
class an
d kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
political control. If land tenure was so significant in
 Europe, it was
equally important in the development of America, where practically all
the first immigrants were forc
ed by circumstances to derive their
livelihood from the soil.

=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, wi
th its broad
extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to
introduce in its entirety and over th
e whole area the system of lords
and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost
every kind of ex
periment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,
was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land,
 though
owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No
man had a separate plot of his own. The
 motto of the community was:
"Labor and share alike." All were supposed to work in the fields and
receive an equal sh
are of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims
attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and
dis
tributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
the workers.

In both colonies the communistic e
xperiments were failures. Angry at the
lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
meals
, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: "Everyone that gathereth
not every day as much as I do, the next day shall b
e set beyond the
river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve." Even
this terrible threat did no
t bring a change in production. Not until
each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered
the f
ruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where
the communal experiment lasted for five years, the
 results were similar
to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate
fields in which every per
son could "set corn for his own particular."
Some other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of
th
eir Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and
labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for i
ndividual ownership of
the land. "By degrees it was seen that even the Lord's people could not
carry the complicated 
communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
practice."

=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, an
d
Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
land tenure found in the proprietary colon
ies, in the seaboard regions
of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact
a powerful feud
al lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He
could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose 
of it all in
large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of
baronial proportions, it was impos
sible for him to manage directly any
considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either
sold it in
 parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, kn
own as
"quit rent." In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day)
 in a single year from this
source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual
tribute into the excheq
uer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,
the king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from 
the
land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit
rent,--"really a feudal payment from fre
eholders,"--was thus a material
source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever
it was laid, 
however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant
irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list 
of
grievances which led to the American Revolution.

Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World app
eared in
the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the
companies, or the proprietors. In t
he colony of Maryland alone there
were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and
tilled by 
tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide ext
ent, most of
which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when
extensive concessions were made to pa
troons to induce them to bring over
settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston
manors were s
o large and populous that each was entitled to send a
representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on th
e New
York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European
estates. They were bound to pay the own
er a rent in money and kind; they
ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial
power because
 he held court and meted out justice, in some instances
extending to capital punishment.

The manors of New York or M
aryland were, however, of slight consequence
as compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge
est
ates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by
slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It 
must not be forgotten
that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
section and gave a decid
ed bent to the economic and political life of
America.

[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]

=The Small Freeh
old.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and
throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms
 of
servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,
the small farm owned outright and tilled by
 the possessor and his
family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the
immigrants. For one th
ing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the
cr
own to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In
many sections, particularly in New England, the
 climate, the stony soil,
the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
moderate compass. Fo
r another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and
German peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did 
not
propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they
could not get freeholds, they would not se
ttle at all; thus they forced
proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
small lots. So
 it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who ti
lled the
farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold
system gave a uniform cast to their 
economic and social life in America.

[Illustration: _From an old print_

A NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]

=Social Effects o
f Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western
settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engage
d in the
same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both
cultivated the soil and possessed the loc
al interest and independence
which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,
however, differed wid
ely.

The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the
English landlord on his estates more t
han he did the colonial farmer who
labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice
and tobacco
 in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his
entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clot
hes,
silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the
ripe old culture of the mother country, 
he often sent his sons to Oxford
or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for
his prosper
ity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to 
buy native
goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
were usually gifted slaves.

The e
conomic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His
crops were not big enough to warrant direct connecti
on with English
factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed
local markets, and they sprang 
up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,
weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
with the r
ough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought
by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinar
ily could not
buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and
between him and the European market s
tood the merchant. His community
was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great
plantations. It w
as more isolated, more provincial, more independent,
more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced 
the New
West.

=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
one respect. Their land hunger
 was never appeased. Each had the eye of
an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as
a fo
othold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration
set in westward, creeping through forests, across 
rivers, and over
mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap
lands, were compelled to go to th
e border; but in a large part the path
breakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third
generations
. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the
mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, foll
owing
their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back
stories of the new regions they travers
ed. Then came the regular
settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes
singly and sometimes
 in companies.

In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
Springfield in 1636 and Great 
Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the
eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west
un
til their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New
York, the inland movement was directed by the 
Hudson River to Albany,
and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,
particularly westward through 
the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early
filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New
Brunswick be
ing made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In
Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lin
es of
advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,
spread over the fertile lands of Berks and 
Lancaster counties, laying
out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the
Susquehanna, and, in
 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of count
ies
a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching
the upper waters of the Ohio while the colo
ny was still under the Penn
family.

In the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was
quickly occu
pied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying b
ack from
the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams
of migration, one westward from the s
ea and the other southward from the
other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing
the main su
pply. "By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing
and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenando
ah was fully
occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.
Before the Declaration of Indep
endence, the oncoming tide of
home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies."

[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF
 POPULATION, 1790]

Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an
invasion that was about to b
reak in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As
early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt
buffaloes, of
 which he had heard weird reports, passed through the
Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awa
iting the
plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers
followed the trail he had blazed. A 
great land corporation, the
Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
times, secured a huge
 grant of territory and sought profits in quit
rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution
th
ere were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older
colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and
 their opposition wrecked
the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the
Continental Congress in
 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
fourteenth colony."


INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Though the
 labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was
a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits.
 Most of the
staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their
beginnings in colonial times. Ma
nufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
numbers. The
 great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
originated in the days when the king of England was "lord of t
hese
dominions."

[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]

=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Indus
try.=--Colonial women, in
addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor
of the open field, 
developed in the course of time a national industry
which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised
 in
abundance in the North and South. "Every farm house," says Coman, the
economic historian, "was a workshop where t
he women spun and wove the
serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear."
By the close of th
e seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth
in sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies 
and to
the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the
more difficult process of dyeing, weavi
ng, and fulling, but carding and
spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,
the Swedes o
f Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior "were not
one whit behind their Yankee neighbors."

The importance o
f this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be
overestimated. For many a century the English had employed t
heir fine
woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the
government had come to look upon it 
as an object of special interest and
protection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and
statesmen nat
urally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;
but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, e
specially of
the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of
customers, here were rivals. In the place
 of helpless reliance upon
English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.

If British merchants had not
 discovered it in the ordinary course of
trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
to t
hem. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americ
ans to his home
government: "The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
once, not only comfortably, b
ut handsomely too, without the help of
England, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government
will s
oon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
in their breasts. This will not seem strange when 
you consider what sort
of people this country is inhabited by."

=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was 
the art of iron
working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a 
forge and skilled artisans within
fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began
at New Londo
n and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,
Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts,
 in
1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had
iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years
 after the founding of the
colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and
the Susquehanna ea
rly in the following century, and iron masters then
laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become o
ne of
the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the
year that saw the introduction of slave
ry. Although the industry soon
lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.
Governor Spotswood wa
s called the "Tubal Cain" of the Old Dominion
because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems
th
at every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,
metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron 
were made in large
quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the
colonists to export rough iron to
 the British Islands.

=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,
shipbuilding was the most 
important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak
for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rop
e
made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a
ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by th
e middle of that century
shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,
Salem, New Bedford, New
port, Providence, New London, and New Haven.
Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade
o
f that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia
soon entered the race and outdistanced New Yor
k, though unable to equal
the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South
Carolina also built ships,
 Southern interest was mainly confined to the
lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and
t
ar.

=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside
of agriculture was the fisheries. This 
industry, started by hardy
sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished
under the indomit
able seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the
net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. "L
ook,"
exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, "at the manner in
which the people of New England have of late
 carried on the whale
fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
behold them penetrating 
into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay
and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arcti
c
circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
cold, that they are at the antipodes and e
ngaged under the frozen
serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
to them than the accum
ulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst
some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
A
frica, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by
 their fisheries. No
climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of
Holland nor the activity
 of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
of English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
ind
ustry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
people."

The influence of the business was widespread
. A large and lucrative
European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught
for food was sold in 
the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or
exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The
lo
wer grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave
consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, 
which furnished
the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These
activities, in turn, stimulated
 shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
shipwr
ights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport
towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with
 the mother
country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and
the West Indies, the colonists p
aid for English manufactures. So an
ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single
industry,
 the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.

=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eigh
teenth
century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction
until it rivaled in the number of peo
ple employed, the capital engaged,
and the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern
historian has 
said: "The enterprising merchants of New England developed
a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the 
world." This
commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
mother country, presented, broadl
y speaking, two aspects.

On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and
agricultural produce. The Sout
hern colonies produced for shipping,
tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,
furs, lu
mber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,
and small articles of manufacture. The variety of pr
oducts was in fact
astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an
American union, once remarked of 
colonial trade: "What sort of dish will
you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,
flax-
seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North
Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, r
ice and indigo,
and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an
absurd jumble will you make if 
you attempt to form a union among such
discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces."

On the other side, A
merican commerce involved the import trade,
consisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and

"India goods." Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,
supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachuset
ts, Rhode Island,
and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern
colonies engaged hundreds of Ne
w England's sailors and thousands of
pounds of her capital.

The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, thoug
h in part
controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large
and important body of American merc
hants like the Willings and Morrises
of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the
Livingsto
ns and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they
were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celeb
rated for
world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages
they enjoyed in British markets and 
under the protection of the British
navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to
contend 
with royal officers in order to shield American interests
against outside interference.

[Illustration: THE DUTCH WES
T INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM
(NEW YORK CITY)]

Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial 
commerce
seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its
significance. It must be considered in relation
 to the growth of English
colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few
startling figures. T
he whole export trade of England, including that to
the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the America
n
Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies
alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words,
 almost as much as the
whole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first
date, colonial trade wa
s but one-twelfth of the English export business;
at the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 170
4,
Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in
1772 the purchases of the same colony amo
unted to $507,909. In short,
Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,
amounting in 1772 t
o almost the entire export trade of England to the
colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were

indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.

=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial
 times made
overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and
harbors along the coast favored a livel
y water-borne trade among the
colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in
the North and th
e many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for
goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior region
s in little
sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,
domestic and foreign, collected at
 some city like Providence, New York,
or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up
the nav
igable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
the raw materials which they had gathered in from ne
ighboring farms.
Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New
England to the Southern colon
ies, where they were traded for tobacco,
leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut
shores
 there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to
Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.

=Grow
th of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry
there grew up along the coast a number of prospero
us commercial centers
which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
British empire, comparin
g favorably in numbers and wealth with such
ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are

mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among
these towns. Serving as the port of entry for
 Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the
Revolution, about 25,00
0 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with
somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the "commercial capital of

Connecticut and old East Jersey," was slightly smaller than Boston, but
growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in
 size was Charleston, South
Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a
center of rum manufac
ture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as "considerable

towns." In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in
Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with gr
owing populations and
increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the
seaboard. The other towns wer
e straggling villages. Williamsburg,
Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a
dozen fami
lies of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county
seats often consisted of nothing more than a log court
house, a prison,
and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the
sessions of the court.

The 
leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
proportion to their population. They were the cen
ters of wealth, for one
thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and
artisans could readily
 take concerted action on public questions arising
from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for 
news,
gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market
places the farmers from the countryside 
learned of British policies and
laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main
currents of opinio
n which set in toward colonial nationalism and
independence.

Chapter III


SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS


Colonial life, crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil, left
scant leisure
 for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. There was
little money in private purses or public treasuries to be de
dicated to
schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long
and widely, and fewer still who cou
ld devote their lives to things that
delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the
intellectual life 
of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic
efforts were made in every community to lift the people above 
the plane
of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests
those efforts were redoubled, and w
ith lengthening years told upon the
thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with
England,
 of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,
political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, a
nd diplomacy
itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American
intellect. No one, not even the most 
critical, can run through the
writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to
Georgia--the Adamse
s, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,
Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,

and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was
something in American colonial life which fostere
d minds of depth and
power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
process of self-education,
 and their keen interest in public issues is
evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her
hu
sband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,
the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen w
ith the British
propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.


THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURC
HES

In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high
importance. There were abundant reasons
 for this. In many of the
colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse
had been one of th
e impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all
the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed th
e only
class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached
on Sundays and taught school on week 
days. They led in the discussion of
local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of
which was co
ncerned with the relation between church and state. They
wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in
 the
colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the
Americans received their formal education. In
 several of the provinces
the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans
were supreme, notwi
thstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplica
tion of
sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in
all of them there was a growing divers
ity of faith, which promised in
time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.

=The Church of England
.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English
system of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were
prescr
ibed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the
governor, the provincial councilors, and the riche
st planters. "The
Established Church," says Lodge, "was one of the appendages of the
Virginia aristocracy. They contr
olled the vestries and the ministers,
and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
planter who b
uilt and managed it." As in England, Catholics and
Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities.
 Only
slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when
once they were even covertly tolerated, t
hey pressed steadily in, until,
by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established
order.

The Chur
ch was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony pa
ssed directly
under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of
the inhabitants were Dissenters
. Against the protests of the Catholics
it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,
notwithstanding th
e resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was
fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embrac
ing about
one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of
proportion to their numbers.

Many factors
 helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the
colonies. It was supported by the British government and th
e official
class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England
were appointed by the king, and it
s faith and service were set forth by
acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it
could 
hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was 
growing up in
America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had
a political role to play here 
as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing
leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
centur
y and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans
 they failed to
calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
Protestants, who still cherished mem
ories of bitter religious conflicts
in the mother country.

=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith ma
de for imperial
unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims
had cast off all allegiance to
 the Anglican Church and established a
separate and independent congregation before they came to America. The
Puritan
s, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,
soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flu
ng off their yoke
of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was
organized, the male members c
hoosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
other officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where
se
cular matters were determined. The union of church and government was
thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life
 prescribed by law and
enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy
instead of imperial unity.


The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and
their fearful denunciations of the faithless.
 They wrote the books for
the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and
eighty-three books an
d pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the
civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan
Sa
bbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and
lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all t
rading, all amusement, and
all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.
A thoughtless maid
 servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a d
evout
Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback
one Sunday evening and was luckless eno
ugh to have a ray of light strike
him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court
and fined 
for "his ungodly conduct." With persons accused of witchcraft
the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of 
persecution swept
over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed
to death, many suffered im
prisonment, and two died in jail.

Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of
Puritan rul
e. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it
with disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the ol
d charter of
the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later
wrested from the Puritans of the 
colony the right to elect their own
governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also
abolished the
 rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting
for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal gove
rnor and an
official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
sympathies, were forced upon Massa
chusetts; and members of all religious
denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were
permitted to 
take part in elections. By this act in the name of the
crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, 
and that
province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
Hampshire, where property, not religi
ous faith, was the test for the
suffrage.

=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of
Virgini
a nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for
other denominations, that principle was strictly appli
ed in Rhode
Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in
matters of conscience was established i
n the beginning. Maryland, by
granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus
Christ, opened its 
gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to
the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those "wh
o
confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the
creator, upholder, and ruler of the World." By o
ne circumstance or
another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
rather than uniformity of 
opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,
Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,
Catholics,
 and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, i
f it had
desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where
one or another church prevailed, bu
t in no colony was a legislature
steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,
and diversit
y, in turn, worked for greater toleration.

The government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
e
conomic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English
state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and P
uritans had no hierarchy
of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.
Neither did they loo
k to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
articles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical

helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The
spirit of independence which led Dissenters 
to revolt in the Old World,
nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made
them all the more
 zealous in the defense of every right against
authority imposed from without.


SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

=Religion and 
Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant
denomination was the education of the children in the fait
h. In this
work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was
indeed the one book of the people. F
armers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in
the Scrip
tures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a
book of romance, travel, and history. "Legend and anna
l," says John
Richard Green, "war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty
voices of prophets, the parabl
es of Evangelists, stories of mission
journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,
apocal
yptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
the most part by any rival learning.... As a mere l
iterary monument, the
English version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English
tongue." It was the Kin
g James version just from the press that the
Pilgrims brought across the sea with them.

For the authority of the Est
ablished Church was substituted the
authority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon
their in
terpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in
America, they ordered all parents and masters of ser
vants to be diligent
in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
works and give answers to 
the religious questions. Massachusetts was
scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was
declared 
to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools
where those not taught at home could receive instruction 
in reading and
writing.

Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
with the same favor; but the whole l
and was nevertheless dotted with
little schools kept by "dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons."
Whether we tur
n to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in
the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and some
times
girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,
fathers and mothers of the better kind gave 
their children the rudiments
of learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show
that the diffus
ion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
progress all through the eighteenth century.

=Religion and Highe
r Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the
establishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded
 in
1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train
"learned and godly ministers" for the Puritan ch
urches of New England.
To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a
mission to the Indians
 and then as a college for the sons of New England
farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College o
f New
Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,
was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two 
colleges looked to the
Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William
and Mary, founded in Vi
rginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia
University, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from t
he
New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
"republican tendencies" of the age. Two col
leges revealed a drift away
from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the
Philadelphia Acade
my, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,
organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration 
by
giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college
 should prepare young men
to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
their country.

=Self-e
ducation in America.=--Important as were these institutions of
learning, higher education was by no means confined wi
thin their walls.
Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in
England. Private tutoring in the
 home was common. In still more families
there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
of 
adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind
and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard
 or William and Mary or
any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose
charming autobiography, in
 addition to being an American classic, is a
fine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was

limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his
self-education continued throughout his life. He early ma
nifested a zeal
for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on
theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's
 writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's
_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with
secular sub
jects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,
Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of t
he
_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely
in natural science and to win single-hand
ed recognition at the hands of
European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts
he "attained a
n acquaintance" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,
thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he wa
s to speak
for all America at the court of the king of France.

Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same pro
cess, were found
all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,
self-educated, the American 
cause drew great strength in the trials of
the Revolution.


THE COLONIAL PRESS

=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The ev
olution of American democracy into a
government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of
political qu
estions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That
too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A prin
ting press was
brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an
official censor and limited to the pu
blication of religious works. Forty
years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious
title, _Pu
blic Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not
been running very long before the government of Massachus
etts suppressed
it for discussing a political question.

Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but 
in 1704
there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,
which proved to be a more lasting enterp
rise because it refrained from
criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When
Franklin's bro
ther, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_
about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one

newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his
confidence in the future was rewarded. In ne
arly every colony a gazette
or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin
Franklin was able to
 record in 1771 that America had twenty-five
newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English

and one in German.

=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,
unlicensed by the government an
d uncontrolled by the church, was,
however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had
never know
n what it was to have the free and open publication of books,
pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of 
printing was
first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical
authorities. After the establishment 
of the State Church in England in
the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal
prerogative.
 Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;
and no one could publish anything without previous approva
l of the
official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,
with a zeal which rivaled that of the c
rown, sought, in turn, to silence
royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the
restoration of th
e monarchy, control of the press was once more placed
in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, 
by
failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official

censorship. By that time political partie
s were so powerful and so
active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all
published matter b
ecame a sheer impossibility.

In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection
with freedom of th
e press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less
anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out
 from
the prying eyes of the people all literature "not mete for them to
read"; and so they established a system of o
fficial licensing for
presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was
more diversity of opini
on and publishers could set up in business with
impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
prin
ting anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the
editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called
 before the
proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,
and for a later offense of a simila
r character he was thrown into jail.
A still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,
who was
 arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who
ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived
 of their licenses to
practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
Philadelphia. By this t
ime the tension of feeling was high, and the
approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
defens
e exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not
that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdic
t for Zenger, when it
finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.
Already the people of King G
eorge's province knew how precious a thing
is the freedom of the press.

Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as 
they were, and to the
vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of
the colonists could rea
d. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the
course o
f public events and grasp the significance of political
arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--
an
independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
around the fireside and at the taverns. Whe
n the day of resistance to
British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person
who could hear the 
voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a
thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men w
ho had
spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's
Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's t
hrilling call to arms.


THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS

Two very distinct lines of development appeared in 
colonial politics.
The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the
drift toward provincial govern
ment through royal officers appointed in
England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was
the gr
owth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each
movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force
 during the
passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals
of government came in the war of 
independence.

=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were
royal provinces in 1776, with gove
rnors appointed by the king. Virginia
passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of
the Lond
on Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost
its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted s
even years later
stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In
the early decades of the eig
hteenth century both the Carolinas were
given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,
severed 
from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the
trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New Y
ork,
transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,
became a province when he took the title 
of James II in 1685. New
Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was
brought directly under
 the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
Delaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the

Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their
governors were as independent of popular choice
 as were the appointees
of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,
retained full self-governmen
t on the eve of the Revolution. They alone
had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.

The chief 
officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed
high and important powers which he naturally sought to au
gment at every
turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,
appointed the civil and militar
y officers. He granted pardons and
reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief
of the mili
tia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provin
ces, except
Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
the legislature and was likely to 
choose those who favored his claims.
He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower
house; 
he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and
he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. He
re were in America
all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had
protested and Cromwell had battled
 in England.

[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]

The colonial governors were generally surroun
ded by a body of
office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen
of broken estates who had com
e to America to improve their fortunes. The
pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges
gran
ted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen
popular antipathy to the British government. Favor
s extended to
adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The
reappearance of this formidable union of
 church and state, from which
they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.

=The Colonial 
Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward
administration through royal governors was the second and opposite
tende
ncy, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.
The voters of England had long been accustomed to sh
are in taxation and
law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early
introduced in America. V
irginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
its first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of
Massachuset
ts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
the corporation to meet at one place, the representativ
e idea was
adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative
system under their "Fundamental O
rders" of 1639, and the entire colony
was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical
considerati
ons, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William
Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government
 as soon as any
considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every
one of the colonies secured 
a popular assembly.

It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was
finally restricted to p
roperty owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to
be
 a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no
house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twe
nty-five feet square.
In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter
of 1691 had to be a fr
eeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterlin
g. In
Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
or more of land well seated, twelve ac
res cleared, and to other persons
worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.

Restrictions like these undoubtedly e
xcluded from the suffrage a very
considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of
the towns, wh
o were by no means content with their position.
Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
f
reehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion
of the colonists were land owners. Thus the a
ssemblies, in spite of the
limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.

The popular character of the assemblies inc
reased as they became engaged
in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by
the executive 
to make provision for the support of the administration,
the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make te
rms in the
interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of
money to pay official salaries and the
n insisted upon electing a
treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the
mysteries of public finan
ce, as well as the management of rapacious
officials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to
force 
the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.

=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As 
may be imagined, many
and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors
and the colonial assem
blies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how
the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive t
o
sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly
humor, Franklin adds: "Do not, my courteou
s reader, take pet at our
proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
legislation. It is a
 happy country where justice and what was your own
before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the v
alue
of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so
blessed."

It must not be thought, however
, that every governor got off as easily
as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like
Caesar, f
ed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
executive prerogatives as they tried out and found the
ir strength. If
we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America
was diminishing when it was st
ruck down altogether. In New York, the
friends of the governor complained in 1747 that "the inhabitants of
plantation
s are generally educated in republican principles; upon
republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a sh
adow of
royal authority remains in the Northern colonies." "Here," echoed the
governor of South Carolina, the followi
ng year, "levelling principles
prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if
he would be ido
lized, must betray his trust; the people have got their
whole administration in their hands; the election of the memb
ers of the
assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical
preferments, are in the disposal or el
ection of the people."

Though baffled by the "levelling principles" of the colonial assemblies,
the governors did no
t give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved
a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the

obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters
to the government in London, consisted of th
ree parts: (1) the royal
officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures
by taxes imposed by
 acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was
to be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters
 were to
be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.

Such a system seemed plausible enou
gh to King George III and to many
ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army
independent o
f the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry
out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning
 seemed both
practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh
from the governors themselves. It
 was wanting in one respect only. It
failed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing
strong 
in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the
tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excell
ent it might be or
how benevolent its intentions.

CHAPTER IV

THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM


It is one of the well-known facts of history that a people loosely
united by do
mestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a
people torn by domestic strife, may be welded into a solid and
 compact
body by an attack from a foreign power. The imperative call to common
defense, the habit of sharing common b
urdens, the fusing force of common
service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside
interference,
 act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,
perhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy all
ays the most
virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. "Politics," runs an old
saying, "stops at the water's edge."


This ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic
circles, applied nearly as well to the original 
thirteen American
colonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common
defense, if not equally great, was
 certainly always pressing. Though it
has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
in "a w
ilderness," this was not actually the case. From the earliest
days of Jamestown on through the years, the American pe
ople were
confronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements
were Indians, growing more and more ho
stile as the frontier advanced and
as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and
west was the
 power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to
the Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the
 British
empire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,
imperial in temper, and prepared to con
test on land and water the
advance of British dominion in America.


RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH

=Indi
an Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the
relations of the colonists to the Indians. The pro
blem was presented in
different shape in different sections of America. It was not handled
according to any coherent 
or uniform plan by the British government,
which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither
di
d the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an
irregular train, have the consistent policy or t
he matured experience
necessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties
arose mainly on the front
iers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
were making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened

was the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel
between traders and an Indian, a jug of whisk
y, a keg of gunpowder, the
exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper
often set in motio
n destructive forces of the most terrible character.

On one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous recor
ds--of
Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of
Roger Williams buying his lands from the f
riendly natives; or of William
Penn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of
the ledger mus
t be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on 
the
Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements
with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with 
equally terrible punishment. A
generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the
Pilgrims, called hi
s tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own

destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially
with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marke
d by periodic and
desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New
England. In 1622 Opecacano,
 a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the
Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he
attempted a
 war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.
Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial g
overnor to put up
an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt
and a successful expedition 
against the Indians. As the Virginia
outposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives
was tra
nsferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to the
southeast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called fo
rth the
combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.

VIRGINIANS DEFENDING
 THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INDIANS]

From such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their
geographic
al location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of
conciliation, was likewise spared until her western van
guard came into
full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever
negotiations and treaties of all
iance, managed to keep on fair terms
with her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor
generosity 
could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,
especially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indian
s in their
imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general
warfare.

[Illustration: ENGLISH,
 FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,
1750]

=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of F
rench
exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English
colonies, engrossed with their own problems
, gave little or no thought
to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in
1642, were too far 
away, too small in population, and too slight in
strength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It
 was
the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in
America, who first grasped the significance of
 the slowly converging
empires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,
rather than the labors o
f Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that
sounded the first note of colonial alarm.

Evidence of this lies in th
e fact that three conflicts between the
English and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
the P
ennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's
War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) o
wed their origins
and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European
powers, although they all invol
ved the American colonies in struggles
with the French and their savage allies.

=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The
 second of these wars had hardly
closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be
seriously alarm
ed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the
West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La 
Salle,
who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed
by the builders of forts. In 1718, th
e French founded New Orleans, thus
taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.
Lawrence. A
 few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they
occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their do
minion
over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this
lofty claim, they set out to make it go
od by constructing in the years
1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper
waters of the Alleg
heny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the
streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington
,
in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory "so
notoriously known to be property of the crown
 of Great Britain," the
French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.

[Illustration: _From an old print
_

BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]

=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the
shot which opened th
e Seven Years' War, known in America as the French
and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There bega
n the
conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved
England and Prussia, on the one side, and Fra
nce, Austria, Spain, and
minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in
1755 and Wolfe's expl
oit in capturing Quebec four years later were the
dramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized
P
russian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the
Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, Britis
h arms were
triumphant. Well could the historian write: "Conquests equaling in
rapidity and far surpassing in magnitu
de those of Cortes and Pizarro had
been achieved in the East." Well could the merchants of London declare
that under 
the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of
this world-wide conflict, commerce had been "united with a
nd made to
flourish by war."

From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war
were momentous. By
 the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of
the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British fl
ag. The
remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French
imperial ambitions on the American c
ontinent were laid to rest. In
exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain
ceded to King 
George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did
Macaulay write in after years that Pitt "was the first Englishm
an of his
time; and he had made England the first country in the world."


THE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES

Th
e various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as
they seem to-day, had a profound influence on co
lonial life and on the
destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular
assemblies, jealous of their i
ndividual powers, compelled cooperation
among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The
American
 people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to
 learn the
arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of
statecraft. These forces, all cumu
lative, drove the colonists, so
tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.

=The New En
gland Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with
the problems presented by the Indian and French menace th
at the
Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many
common ties among the settlers of New Engl
and, it required a deadly
fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,
composed of Massachus
etts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The
colonies so united were bound together in "a firm and perpetual leagu
e
of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and
succor, upon all just occasions." They made pro
vision for distributing
the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
commissioners from each 
colony to determine upon common policies. For
some twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold

meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate
border.

Virginia, no less than Massachuset
ts, was aware of the importance of
intercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the
Old Domin
ion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the
colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virgin
ia met at Albany
with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of
mutual defense. A few years lat
er the Old Dominion cooperated loyally
with the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.

=The Alb
any Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was
made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade
 in England, a
conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise
measures of defense against the 
French, and to enter into "articles of
union and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's
subjects and 
interests in North America as well in time of peace as of
war." New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Isla
nd, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a
plan of union, drafted mainly, 
it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was
adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The
colonies, jealou
s of their individual rights, refused to accept the
scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said,
 that
it had "too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution."
Though the Albany union failed, the docume
nt is still worthy of study
because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved
until thirty-thr
ee years afterward, when another convention of which
also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the Unite
d
States.

[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]

=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed
t
he provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
of defending their institutions. Particularly
 was this true of the last
French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to
the Carolinas and ma
de heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,
it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British governm
ent and
the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands
of Americans got a taste, a strong tas
te, of actual fighting in the
field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that
were not forgo
tten in after years. They saw what American militiamen
could do under favorable circumstances and they watched Britis
h regulars
operating on American soil. "This whole transaction," shrewdly remarked
Franklin of Braddock's campaign, "
gave us Americans the first suspicion
that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not
been we
ll founded." It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel
who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took
 command of the
army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had "spurned the
whistle of bullets" at the memorabl
e battle in western Pennsylvania.

=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were
learning 
lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the
conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Phili
p's war left
New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was
especially expensive. The twent
y-five thousand men put in the field by
the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper
currency str
eamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce
was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced
. When the
end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy
liabilities, and to make matters worse ther
e was a fall of prices
accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
ten years. It was in th
e midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quar
rel
which led to American independence.

=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the
defe
at administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to
estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy 
circumstance
that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no
foreign power at hand to aid them
 in case they struck for independence.
American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis
were 
driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country
to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At al
l events, France,
though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,
as events proved, it was the
 fortunate French alliance negotiated by
Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the
Revolut
ion.


COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT

It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finall
y brought
forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife
with the mother country which culminate
d in union for the war of
independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the
colonies alone. Th
e character of the English sovereigns, the course of
events in English domestic politics, and English measures of con
trol
over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be
taken into account.

=The Last of the Stuar
ts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)
and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime
(16
49-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had
little time to think of colonial policies or to
 interfere with colonial
affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by
internal peace and the incr
easing power of the mercantile classes in the
House of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II
(1660-85
), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade
by act of Parliament was developed into a closely kni
t system and
powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same
time a system of stricter control 
over the dominions was ushered in by
the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so
much self-g
overnment on the Puritans.

Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
authority in the 
colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus
inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his th
rone, he
would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
dominions a revolution like that which
 he precipitated at home in 1688.
He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more
efficient adminis
tration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He
made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New Engla
nd, New
York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last
days of his brother's reign, he cont
inued to ignore, and that of
Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and
hidden, accordin
g to tradition, in a hollow oak.

For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of
ill-tempered despo
tism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not
accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his
o
pinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the
Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the wr
it of _habeas corpus_ to
a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle
of his arbitrary cou
rse, however, his hand was stayed. The news came
that King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the pe
ople
of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to
dispose of Andros. The response was promp
t and hearty. The hated
governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under
guard.

The overthrow o
f James, followed by the accession of William and Mary
and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effec
t in the
colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was
given another charter which, though
 not so liberal as the first,
restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the
other colonies 
where Andros had been operating, the old course of
affairs was resumed.

=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=
--On the death in 1714 of
Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a
Hanoverian prince who, th
ough grateful for English honors and revenues,
was more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II
,
whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to
speak the English language, at least withou
t an accent. The necessity of
taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
stoutest defender 
of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no
ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by t
he king.
Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs
was in the hands of an astute leader,
 Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed
his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: "Let
sleeping dogs 
lie." He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
by exclaiming: "I will not be the minister to enforce taxes a
t the
expense of blood." Such kings and such ministers were not likely to
arouse the slumbering resistance of the thi
rteen colonies across the
sea.

=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from
James II to Ge
orge III ventured to interfere with colonial matters
personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by 
royal
officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision
began in 1660, when there was created 
by royal order a committee of the
king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider
petitions,
 memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696
a regular board was established, known as the "Lords of
 Trade and
Plantations," which continued, until the American Revolution, to
scrutinize closely colonial business. The
 chief duties of the board were
to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those
assemblies f
or adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the
colonies relative to their affairs.

The methods employed b
y this board were varied. All laws passed by
American legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.

If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the
exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disa
llowance. Any person
who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
could be heard by the boa
rd in person or by attorney; in such cases it
was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
in
volved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,
therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employ
ed on the
suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in
addition to the powers exercised by t
he governors in the royal
provinces.

=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the
colonie
s was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The
king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and
 exercised high
appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right
of appeal from local courts, ex
pressly set forth in some charters, was,
on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in
Eng
land or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by
any act of a colonial legislature or any decision
 of a colonial court,
had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the
king in council, forcin
g his opponent to follow him across the sea. In
the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a cour
t
could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
enacted and approved, null and void, on the g
round that they were
contrary to English law.

=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year

after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over
colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the
 British governors in
the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
duty on European goods imp
orted in English vessels. Again, when North
Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as
"restricti
ve upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures
throughout the continent." At other times, Indian trade was 
regulated in
the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
legislature were set aside. Virginia 
was forbidden to close her ports to
North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.

In short, foreign and intercolo
nial trade were subjected to a control
higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the
Constitution of t
he United States was to commit to Congress the power to
regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with th
e Indians.
A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the
Supreme Court at Washington now tow
ers above the states, kept the
colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In
the thousands
 of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the
rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real his
tory of
British imperial control over the American colonies.

So great was the business before the Lords of Trade tha
t the colonies
had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As
common grievances against the oper
ation of this machinery of control
arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with
the merchant
s in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld thes
e bodies into a
common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the
repeated minor irritations wer
e added general and sweeping measures of
Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.

=P
arliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament
gained in power at the expense of the king, it re
ached out to bring the
American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of
Charles I and the accession
 of George III, there was enacted an immense
body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of

America. All of it, based on the "mercantile" theory then prevalent in
all countries of Europe, was designed to contr
ol the overseas
plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
interests of the mother country, w
here merchants and men of finance had
got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the
British empir
e should be confined to agriculture and the production of
raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods o
f England.

_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of
British colonial policy must be placed 
the navigation laws framed for
the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so
essential in 
defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and
French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 
1651 and
it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II
(1660-85).

The Navigation Acts, in effect,
 gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
British ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and
her do
minions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No
European goods could be brought to America save in t
he ships of the
country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were
almost fatal to Dutch shipping
 in America, fell with severity upon the
colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse
effect, 
however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated
shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materi
als gave
the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother
country. Thus the colonists in the end 
profited from the restrictive
policy written into the Navigation Acts.

_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second 
group of laws was
deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
sharply with those of England.
 Among the earliest of these measures may
be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen
goo
ds from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of 
an inquiry, that New
England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending
large numbers annually to 
the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,
and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that "no hats or felts,

dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be "put upon any vessel
or laden upon any horse or cart with intent t
o export to any place
whatever." The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
ruinous. A few years lat
er a similar blow was given to the iron
industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were
given fr
ee entry to England to encourage the production of the raw
material; but at the same time the law provided that "no m
ill or other
engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a
tilt hammer, and no furnace for 
making steel" should be built in the
colonies. As for those already built, they were declared public
nuisances and or
dered closed. Thus three important economic interests of
the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were la
id under the
ban.

_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the
British Parliament relate
d to the sale of colonial produce. An act of
1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain
o
r to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to
the continent of Europe had to pass through a
 British port paying custom
duties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual
commission. At first tobac
co was the only one of the "enumerated
articles" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest
coming mai
nly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,
however, other commodities were added to the list of enumera
ted
articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,
hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This 
was not all. The colonies
were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English
ports, paying duties 
to the government and commissions to merchants
again.

_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the inte
rest of
English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the
British West Indies against competition
 from their French and Dutch
neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
with the French i
slands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar
and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low pri
ces. Acting
on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,
Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous 
Molasses Act imposing duties on
sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
countries--rates which wou
ld have destroyed the American trade with the
French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, wer
e
not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawf
ul traffic.

=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly
of her colonial trade which Spain
 consistently sought to maintain, the
policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the
restrictive l
aws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for exam
ple,
redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers
of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in g
eneral. Favors in British
ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors
and in some instanc
es bounties were paid by England to encourage
colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in
t
he argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
colonists gained more than they lost by British t
rade and industrial
legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when
free from these old restrict
ions, the Americans found themselves
handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
and the r
ecipients of bounties in English markets.

Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
ag
ainst the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
enacted previous to the close of the French and 
Indian war. Relatively
few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
in farming and planting
, so that England's policy of restricting America
to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority 
of
the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
and carried on in connection with their dom
estic duties, so that it was
not the sole support of any considerable number of people.

As a matter of fact, moreove
r, the restrictive laws, especially those
relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were
boldl
y sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
English government, to which duties should have been
 paid. Sugar and
molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New
England in spite of the law. Royal
 officers sometimes protested against
smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed
in stop
ping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of "the galling
restraints of trade" until after the French war, whe
n the British
government suddenly entered upon a new course.


SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD

In the period between 
the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,
in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a per
iod of
a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent
to take its place among the powers of 
the earth. It was an epoch of
migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and
nationalities. The En
glish led the way. Next to them in numerical
importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot
w
ere also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands
of negroes were brought from Africa to till So
uthern fields or labor as
domestic servants in the North.

Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, 
the Pilgrims
and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and
Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland
, fled from intolerant governments
that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of
their consc
iences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands
, like the
negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of
adventure appealed to the restless 
and the lure of profits to the
enterprising merchants.

How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods bande
d together
and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other
cases great trading companies were 
organized to found colonies. Again it
was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who
undertook 
to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their
own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for 
a term of years
in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account
of the profits derived from 
their sale as slaves.

Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get
across the sea. The immigra
nts set to work with a will. They cut down
forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,
schools
, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and
wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They 
bartered and
traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
commerce--Boston, Providence, Ne
w York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
they presse
d westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they
were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.

Though the
y were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,
the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. 
The major
portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the
literature of England furnished the basis 
of national unity. Most of the
colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a
wilderness. To ties
 of kinship and language were added ties created by
necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the India
ns and
later against the French. They were all subjects of the same
sovereign--the king of England. The English Parli
ament made laws for
them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their
trade, and their manufactur
es. Common forces assailed them. Common
grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.

Many of the things which 
tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them

were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled
it with their own hands. A free soil nourished
 the spirit of freedom.
The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the
Church of England, that st
anch defender of the British monarchy. Each
colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it
gr
ew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a
people learning self-reliance and self-governmen
t. The attempts to
strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of
colonies into royal province
s only fanned the spirit of independence
which they were designed to quench.

Nevertheless, the Americans owed much o
f their prosperity to the
assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection
of the British navy
 that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from
wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were

controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed
great advantages in her markets. Free trade exi
sted nowhere upon the
earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and
merchandise. It could be 
said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their
indus
try and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.
Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere
 economic advantage is
not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A
thousand circumstances had he
lped to develop on this continent a nation,
to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a
de
stiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British
empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic u
nassailable that
America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the
spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel
 Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George
Washington.

PART II. CONFLICT AND INDEPENDENCE




CHAPTER V


THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY


On October 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to

his young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover
and Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was 
a thorough German who never
even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.
The second George n
ever saw England until he was a man. He spoke English
with an accent and until his death preferred his German home. D
uring
their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did
not govern but acted only through mini
sters representing the majority in
Parliament.


GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM

=The Character of the New King.=--The thi
rd George rudely broke the
German tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a
foreigner and on 
all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.
To the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the 
popular
phrase: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
Briton." Macaulay, the English historian, 
certainly of no liking for
high royal prerogative, said of George: "The young king was a born
Englishman. All his tas
tes and habits, good and bad, were English. No
portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,

his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated
public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his 
person and address were
pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without
glaring absurdity ascrib
e to him many princely virtues."

Nevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and
his courtie
rs. Under their influence he developed high and mighty
notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty t
o check
the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His
mother had dinned into his ears the sl
ogan: "George, be king!" Lord
Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him
to take an acti
ve part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers w
ho encouraged
him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all
parties, and to place himself at the h
ead of the nation and empire.

GEORGE III]

=Political Parties and George III.=-
-The state of the political parties
favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
the crown.
 The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller
freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant
non-
conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long
continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up m
any enemies in
their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up
all hope of restoring to the t
hrone the direct Stuart line; but they
still cherished their old notions about divine right. With the
accession of Ge
orge III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
around the throne again. George received his Tory friends with
 open
arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.

=The British Parliamentary System.=--T
he peculiarities of the British
Parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies
with their des
igns for controlling the entire government. In the first
place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary 
nobles whose
number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as
of old. Though the members of the
 House of Commons were elected by
popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great
towns like L
eeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no
representatives at all. While there were about eight million in
habitants
in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is
to say, only about one in every ten
 adult males had a voice in the
government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons
although they h
ad merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often cont
rolled by
lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.
The "rotten-boroughs," as they wer
e called by reformers, were a public
scandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into
the Hou
se of Commons.


GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES

=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year aft
er the accession of
George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him
with "gross incivility" 
and the crowds shouting "Pitt forever!" The
direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's
confidence.
 Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,
a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned ove
r the increasing
cost of government.

The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
of the 
disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest
point in the history of the country. More revenue w
as absolutely
necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention
finally to the American colonies.
 In this quest he had the aid of a
zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public
service and was 
familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
governors in America. These two men, with the support of the enti
re
ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, "a new system of colonial
government. It was announced by authority that 
there were to be no more
requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but
that the colonies we
re to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.
Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to

be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the
expenses of this force were to be met by parliament
ary taxation."

=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed
before the board of trade were 
vigorous protests against the issuance of
paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a
remed
y in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws
authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstand
ing bills. This
law was aimed at the "cheap money" which the Americans were fond of
making when specie was scarce--mo
ney which they tried to force on their
English creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
princ
ipal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long
battle over sound money on this continent.

=Limitation
 on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)
George III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other
 things,
for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
Paris from the French. One of the pro
visions in this royal decree
touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's
officers and the colo
nists over the disposition of western lands had
been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on
settleme
nt. The more adventurous were continually moving west and
"squatting" on land purchased from the Indians or simply se
ized without
authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases
from the Indians, reserving to 
the crown the right to acquire such lands
and dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same
proclama
tion vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,
including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of roya
l officers in
the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise
were declared to be in the inter
est of the crown and for the
preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.

=The Sugar Act of 1
764.=--King George's ministers next turned their
attention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt un
der
which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
America, nothing seemed more reasonable to
 them than the proposition
that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
upon the English ta
xpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this
reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for
 it was
set forth clearly in the title: "An act for granting certain duties in
the British colonies and plantations i
n America ... for applying the
produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,
protecting and
 securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for
more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goo
ds to and
from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
trade between the same and Great Brit
ain." The old Molasses Act had been
prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue
measure. Spe
cified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,
and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The
 enforcement
of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had
"teeth in it." Special precaution
s as to bonds, security, and
registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised
a vigorous execut
ion of the new revenue law.

The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative
measures. Under a 
law of the previous year the commanders of armed
vessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,

search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial
ports. By supplementary orders, the entire Briti
sh official force in
America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
navigation laws. Revenue
 collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full dut
y
in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge
of official obligations were sharpened by 
an appeal to avarice, for
naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by
large prizes out of th
e forfeitures and penalties.

=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved
steadily towards its
 goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration
in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The ne
xt
year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded
its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 
205 in favor to 49 against;
while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality
of a count. As G
eorge III was temporarily insane, the measure received
royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Pro
tests of
colonial agents in London were futile. "We might as well have hindered
the sun's progress!" exclaimed Frankl
in. Protests of a few opponents in
the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and
from all ap
pearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid
interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded th
at the fateful
measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
act for the king when he was i
ncapacitated.

The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British
government to raise revenue in 
America "towards defraying the expenses
of defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and
plantations i
n America." It was a long measure of more than fifty
sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisi
ons
duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, 
bail bonds,--on
licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing
cards, dice, pamphlets, newspa
pers, almanacs, calendars, and
advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything
escaped.

=The Qu
artering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp
Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they 
could not
conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General
Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America
 well, gave them an ominous
warning in the Commons. "Believe me--remember I this day told you so--"
he exclaimed, "th
e same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their 
liberties
and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated." The
answer of the ministry to a prophecy of 
force was a threat of force.
Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of
soldiers than usual to
 the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the
col
onists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
the new laws. "We have the power to tax them," 
said one of the ministry,
"and we will tax them."


COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL

=Popular Opposition.=--The Sta
mp Act was greeted in America by an
outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the
lead in m
aking a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to
import British goods while the hated law stood upon the b
ooks. Lawyers,
some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
intimidated by patriots who re
fused to permit them to use stamped
papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had
long grum
bled at the administration of royal governors, protested
against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had don
e in old
England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many
of them of the official class--who 
denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
Whig aristocrats as "seditious, factious and republican." Yet the
opposition to
 the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering
Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.

In a 
little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
countryside. All through the North and in some of the South
ern colonies,
there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to
resist the Stamp Act to the bitter
 end. These popular societies were
known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including
artisans, 
mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both
groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little
 part in public
affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the
right to vote for colonial a
ssemblymen.

While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
drafting well-phrased protests 
against British measures, the Sons of
Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred
up rio
ts in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts
were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burn
ed the residences of
high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by
threats and intimidation cu
rtailed the sale of British goods and the use
of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operation
s
to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
frightened and drew back in astonishment at the for
ces they had
unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very
effective resistance to the sale 
of the hated goods by spurring on
domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture
of clothin
g, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to
feed and clothe their families without buying British goo
ds.

=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial
assemblies, accustomed to battle against Br
itish policies, supported the
popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,
the Virginia Ho
use of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to
 lay taxes
upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjus
t." It was in support of these
resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: "Caesar
had his Brutus,
 Charles I his Cromwell, and George III...." Cries of
"Treason" were calmly met by the orator who finished: "George I
II may
profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it."

[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]

=The Stamp 
Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call
of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates 
to a Congress to
be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded
and sent representatives. The 
delegates, while professing the warmest
affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record
a ser
ies of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They
declared that taxes could not be imposed without their co
nsent, given
through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed
a tendency to subvert their righ
ts and liberties; that the recent trade
acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the
king an
d Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made "humble
supplication" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.

The Stam
p Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked
the rise of a new agency of government to express the 
will of America.
It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
government of George III in the c
olonies. It foreshadowed the Congress
of the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt
at uni
on. "There ought to be no New England men," declared Christopher
Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, "no New Yorkers 
known on the
Continent, but all of us Americans."

=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of Am
erican
resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies
had been effectively boycotted by the
 Americans; ships lay idly swinging
at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,
Bristol, a
nd Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England
were thrown out of employment. The government had sown
 folly and was
reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.

Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the mini
sters summoned to the
bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for
Pennsylvania, who was in London. 
"Do you think it right," asked
Grenville, "that America should be protected by this country and pay no
part of the ex
penses?" The answer was brief: "That is not the case; the
colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twen
ty-five
thousand men and spent many millions." Then came an inquiry whether the
colonists would accept a modified sta
mp act. "No, never," replied
Franklin, "never! They will never submit to it!" It was next suggested
that military for
ce might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready
answer. "They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may n
ot find a
rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."

The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a fe
w days
later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts
due British merchants placed in jeopard
y, Manchester industries closed,
workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the
colonies threatene
d. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close
of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in 
favor
of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.
"America must learn," he wailed, "that prayers
 are not to be brought to
Caesar through riot and sedition." His protests were idle. The Commons
agreed to the repeal
 on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
victorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of
st
rong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now
restored to his right mind.

In rescinding the 
Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of
the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the con
trary, it
accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the
colonies were subordinate to the crown
 and Parliament of Great Britain;
that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
laws binding
 the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the
resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authori
ty were
null and void.

The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
demonstrations. Bells were rung; t
oasts to the king were drunk; and
trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper
resolution, d
id not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthe
ned by the
news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically
restoring the condition of affairs before
 Grenville and Townshend
inaugurated their policy of "thoroughness."


RESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL P
OLICIES

=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.
Though Pitt, the friend of America, wa
s once more prime minister, and
seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness
gave to Towns
hend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.
Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshen
d brought
forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,
which to this day are associated with 
his name. First among his
restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement
of the collection 
of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, re
sident in
the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all
control by the colonists. The second m
easure of the same date imposed a
tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into
the colonies
, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal co
lonial
officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the
tea trade which the Americans carried
 on illegally with foreigners. This
law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in
England on tea 
exported to America, for it was thought that English tea
merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American 
tea
smugglers.

=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been
content with laying duties, just 
as a manifestation of power and right,
and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of
the To
wnshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the
harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs office
rs to remain at
their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,
1767, it expressly authorized
 the superior courts of the colonies to
issue "writs of assistance," empowering customs officers to enter "any
house,
 warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies
or plantations in America to search for and seize" p
rohibited or
smuggled goods.

The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to
revenue officers, 
was an ancient device hateful to a people who
cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
g
ains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a "minion of the law"
to enter a man's house and search his papers an
d premises, was too much
for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for
self-government and free h
omes, who had braved such hardships to
establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.

The wr
it of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violen
t hostility at that
time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
arose in connection with the
 application of a customs officer to a
Massachusetts court for writs of assistance "as usual." This application
was v
ainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a
speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent eve
ry man who heard it
away "ready to take up arms against writs of assistance." Otis denounced
the practice as an exerc
ise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the
li
berty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work
possible malice on any innocent citizen on the mer
est suspicion, and to
spread terror and desolation through the land. "What a scene," he
exclaimed, "does this open! E
very man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a
writ
 of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary
exertion will provoke another until society is in
volved in tumult and
blood." He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament
could not establish it 
because it was against the British constitution.
This was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quic
kly
echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to
America to resist the exercise of arbitrary p
ower by royal officers.
"Then and there," wrote John Adams, "the child Independence was born."
Such was the hated wri
t that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of
customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.

=T
he New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's
Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a 
still more drastic step.
The assembly of New York, protesting against the "ruinous and
insupportable" expense involve
d, had failed to make provision for the
care of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering
Act. Pa
rliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
obey the law. It was not until a third election was he
ld that compliance
with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the
meantime, all the colonies h
ad learned on how frail a foundation their
representative bodies rested.


RENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA

=The Massac
husetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the
leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of rene
wed
intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a
Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of 
the other colonies
informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly
condemning the whole British p
rogram. The Circular Letter declared that
Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent
and
 that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be
represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to subm
it to
consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
who were subjected to governors and ju
dges appointed by the crown and
paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,
in the most te
mperate tones, to take thought about the common
predicament in which they were all placed.

[Illustration: _From an o
ld print._

SAMUEL ADAMS]

=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing
of the Circular L
etter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On
meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgi
a, and
South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also
dissolved at once. The Virginia House of 
Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of
imposing taxes in
 Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew
the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transporta
tion of
persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the
king for a redress of the general grie
vances. The immediate dissolution
of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal
governor.

=The 
Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities
kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, 
the houses of
citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
the centers of discontent. Mercha
nts again agreed not to import British
goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about
the pa
tronage of home products still more loyally.

On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began t
o
jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things
went from bad to worse until some "boys and yo
ung fellows" began to
throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the
crowd, killing five an
d wounding half a dozen more. The day after the
"massacre," a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was

sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated
and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentle
ss, the governor yielded
and ordered the regulars away.

The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire t
o Georgia.
Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.
Their defense was undertaken, in 
spite of the wrath of the populace, by
John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst

offenders
 entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the
jury, however, Adams warned the British government agains
t its course,
saying, that "from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
town will always occasion two 
mobs where they will prevent one." Two of
the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.

=Resistance in the South
.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some
citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal govern
or,
openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven
who were taken prisoners were hanged as tra
itors. A little later royal
troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,
called the "Lexingt
on of the South."

=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as
well as on land, friction b
etween the royal officers and the colonists
broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for

smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was
caught fast. During the night several men fro
m Providence boarded the
vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,
sent to Rhode Island
 to discover the offenders and bring them to
account, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very
ap
pointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to
action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses
 passed a resolution
creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
among the colonies in res
istance to British measures.

=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the
Townshend revenue
 act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except
that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the o
ther
commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,
Parliament decided to relieve the British East 
India Company of the
financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
Tea Act and the colonial
 boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to
return to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on
a
ll tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be
collected in America, was left as a reminder of 
the principle laid down
in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the
colonists.

This arrangement 
with the East India Company was obnoxious to the
colonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one
t
hing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it
promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, a
n immense amount of
cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large
stocks on hand. It threat
ened with ruin the business of all those who
were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an

irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New
York, and Boston, captains of ships who broug
ht tea under this act were
roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,
disguised as Indi
ans, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, fl
agrant,
determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed
it.


RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVER
NMENT

=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in
Boston confirmed King George in his conv
iction that there should be no
soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. "The die is cast," he
stated with e
vident satisfaction. "The colonies must either triumph or
submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubte
dly be very
meek." Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as "the
proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous ra
bble who ought, if they had
the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not
trouble themselves wit
h politics and government, which they do not
understand." This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of

Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.
Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to sup
port the government in
upholding its authority.

=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 177
4,
passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five
"intolerable acts." They were aimed at curin
g the unrest in America. The
_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to
commerce with the o
utside world. The _second_, following closely,
revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore tha
t
the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should
be named by the royal governor, and that tow
n meetings (except to elect
certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. A
_third_ measure, af
ter denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful
government" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer 
to
Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
persons accused of murder in connection with th
e enforcement of the law.
The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts
towns. The _fifth_ of 
the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted
religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundari
es
of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western
region, government by a viceroy.

The into
lerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary
celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it
 was
ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,
condemning it roundly for punishing the innoce
nt with the guilty, and
showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He
was heard with respect
 and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both
houses without a division, the entry "unanimous" being made upon t
heir
journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.
The law destroying the charter of Massac
husetts passed the Commons by a
vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
one. The tri
umph of the ministry was complete. "What passed in Boston,"
exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, "is the overt
 act of High
Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight." The
crown and Parliament were united in 
resorting to punitive measures.

In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the
American Protestan
ts, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That
project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direc
t
attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The
British government did not grant religious tol
eration to Catholics
either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive
in granting it in North 
America. The act was also offensive because
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,
large
 claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.

To enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British
g
overnment was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed
forces in America, General Gage, was appointed g
overnor of
Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King
George was to give "the rebels," 
as he called them, a taste of strong
medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.


FROM REFORM TO
 REVOLUTION IN AMERICA

=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the
destruction of charters
, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
a new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with t
he
British ministry, the Americans spoke of their "rights as Englishmen"
and condemned the acts of Parliament as unla
wful, as violating the
principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When
they saw that such arg
uments had no effect on Parliament, they turned
for support to their "natural rights." The latter doctrine, in the fo
rm
in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the
constitutional argument. John Locke had used it w
ith good effect in
defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American
leaders, familiar with the 
writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in
the hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did

not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the
crown. "Old Magna Carta was not the beginning 
of all things," retorted
Otis when the constitutional argument failed. "A time may come when
Parliament shall declare
 every American charter void, but the natural,
inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citize
ns
would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
until the general conflagration." Of the same 
opinion was the young and
impetuous Alexander Hamilton. "The sacred rights of mankind," he
exclaimed, "are not to be 
rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
d
estiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or
obscured by mortal power."

Firm as the American le
aders were in the statement and defense of their
rights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning th
ey
hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly
avowed that they were loyal to the king whe
n protesting in the strongest
language against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a
firebrand, was
 in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
concessions from England. "I argue this cause with the greater
ple
asure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
assistance, "as it is in favor of British liberty ... an
d as it is in
opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods
cost one king of England his hea
d and another his throne."

=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of
American sentiment was
 correctly measured by one Englishman at least,
Edmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
A
merican democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He
saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of thing
s was the American
spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that
there were three ways of h
andling the delicate situation--and only
three. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
the
 colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
in the essential circumstances of American life. 
The second was to
prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his
countrymen to beware lest the coloni
sts declare that "a government
against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
government to whic
h submission is equivalent to slavery." The third and
right way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept t
he
American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies
into equal partnership.

=Events Produce 
the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,
was equally impossible to George III and the majority in Par
liament. To
their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American
resistance unlawful, riotous, and trea
sonable. The correct way, in their
view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the "rebels"; and that very
act took th
e contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:
"Facts are stubborn things." Opinions were unseen, but march
ing soldiers
were visible to the veriest street urchin. "Now," said Gouverneur
Morris, "the sheep, simple as they are
, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
It was too late to talk about the excellence of the British
constitution. If any o
ne is bewildered by the controversies of modern
historians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his
unde
rstanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately oration, _On
Conciliation with America_.

CHA
PTER VI

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION


RESISTANCE AND RETALIATION

=The Continental Congress.=--When the news of the "int
olerable acts"
reached America, every one knew what strong medicine Parliament was
prepared to administer to all thos
e who resisted its authority. The
cause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition
to British 
policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national
character. To local committees and provincial convention
s was added a
Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,
1774, at the instigation of Sam
uel Adams. The response to the summons
was electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
during t
he summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in
Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest m
en in America
were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John
and Samuel Adams from Massachuse
tts. Every shade of opinion was
represented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored
moderation.


The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in
clear and dignified language the grievances of t
he colonists. It
approved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and
promised the united support
 of all sections. It prepared an address to
King George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of

independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British
government.

=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--
The Congress was not content, however,
with professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary
step. 
It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,
and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in t
he hands of local
"committees of safety and inspection," to be elected by the qualified
voters. The significance of t
his action is obvious. Congress threw
itself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and
to be 
carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within
the British state and laid down a test of allegian
ce to the new order.
The colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose
one authority or the other
. They were for the enforcement of the
non-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought
English 
goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--"May Britain
be wise and America be free"--the first Continental C
ongress adjourned
in October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting
of a second Congress, shoul
d necessity require.

=Lord North's "Olive Branch."=--When the news of the action of the
American Congress reached En
gland, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal
of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime
m
inister, Lord North, was a set of "conciliatory resolutions" proposing
to relieve from taxation any colony that would
 assume its share of
imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
the crown. This "olive 
branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and 
by
the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the
commerce of New England.

=Bloodshed at Lexin
gton and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the
British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts
 in
upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military
stores had been collected at Concord, dispatch
ed a small force to seize
them. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.
At Lexington, on the
 road to Concord, occurred "the little thing" that
produced "the great event." An unexpected collision beyond the tho
ught
or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
battle field.

=The Second Continental C
ongress.=--Though blood had been shed and war
was actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at
Phi
ladelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was
beyond human power. It petitioned the king to int
erpose on behalf of the
colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil
war. On the last day o
f July, it made a temperate but firm answer to
Lord North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was
unsa
tisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
the offensive acts of Parliament.

=Force, the Brit
ish Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America
were about to present the last petition of Congress to the king 
on
August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This
announcement declared that the colonists, "mi
sled by dangerous and
ill-designing men," were in a state of insurrection; it called on the
civil and military powers
 to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
threatened with "condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and
abetto
rs of such traitorous designs." It closed with the usual prayer:
"God, save the king." Later in the year, Parliament 
passed a sweeping
act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was
silent at last. Force was also 
America's answer.


AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE

=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of
r
econciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved
to defend American rights by arms if necessary
. It transformed the
militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,
into a Continental army
 and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.
It assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wa
ge
war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.

[Illustration: _From an old print_

SPIRIT OF 1776
]

Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by
the stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed t
hat it could make British
regulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took command
of the army at Cam
bridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments
in drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and
 Ireland,
the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of
Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a h
andsome figure, for thousands
of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to
America. Such wa
s the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
of the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the c
onservative
historian Lecky: "The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to
subdue the essentially English p
opulation beyond the Atlantic made
reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable." The news of this
wretched tr
ansaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America
before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that 
Washington
had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with
his entire army for Halifax.

=The 
Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were
bearing the Americans away from their old position
 under the British
constitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their
desires, prudent and honorable me
n, who cherished the ties that united
them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
revolution
, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In
all parts of the country and among all classes, the que
stion of the hour
was being debated. "American independence," as the historian Bancroft
says, "was not an act of sudd
en passion nor the work of one man or one
assembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
and
 merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the
coast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town mee
tings and from the
pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county
conventions and conferences or c
ommittees; in colonial congresses and
assemblies."

[Illustration: _From an old print_

THOMAS PAINE]

=Paine's "Comm
onsense."=--In the midst of this ferment of American
opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesit
ating
public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and
without apologies. In the early days of 1776
, Thomas Paine issued the
first of his famous tracts, "Commonsense," a passionate attack upon the
British monarchy an
d an equally passionate plea for American liberty.
Casting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hi
therto
addressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
with many a violent epithet. He condemn
ed monarchy itself as a system
which had laid the world "in blood and ashes." Instead of praising the
British constit
ution under which colonists had been claiming their
rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was
 "owing
to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the
government, that the Crown is not as oppres
sive in England as in
Turkey."

Having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
order, Paine pr
oceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
separation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of
p
ractical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the
mother country. Allegiance to her had been resp
onsible for the many wars
in which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty
in behalf of indepe
ndence. "Our corn will fetch its price in any market
in Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them wher
e we
will." As to matters of government, "it is not in the power of Britain
to do this continent justice; the busines
s of it will soon be too
weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
convenience by a power so d
istant from us and so very ignorant of us."

There is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.
"Everyt
hing that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of
the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis 
time to part.' ...
Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the
choice of the king and the cont
inent hath accepted the challenge.... The
sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a
city,
 a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not
the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity
 is involved in the
contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
proceedings now. Now is the s
eed-time of Continental union, faith, and
honor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the
tyranny
, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be
extinct. Let none other be heard among us than those 
of a good citizen,
an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
mankind and of the free and
 independent states of America." As more than
100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots
excl
aimed with Washington: "Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!"

=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Officia
l support for the
idea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of
February, 1776, Gadsden, in 
the provincial convention of South Carolina,
advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
fo
r all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way
by abolishing the system of royal administration
 and establishing a
complete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the
neighboring state of North Caro
lina uttered the daring phrase from which
others shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to
concur w
ith the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly

responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May
15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia t
o propose the independence
of the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of
separation. When t
he resolution was carried the British flag on the
state house was lowered for all time.

Meanwhile the Continental Co
ngress was alive to the course of events
outside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. "Are
we re
bels?" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.
"No: we must declare ourselves a free people." Others
 hesitated and
spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. "Is
not America already independent
?" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.
"Why not then declare it?" Still there was uncertainty and delegates
avoided
 the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,
Congress declared that the authority of the British c
rown in America
must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
their own.

 an old print_

THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]


=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,
on June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Cong
ress moved that "these
united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
states." A committee was imm
ediately appointed to draft a formal
document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the
states sav
e New York went on record in favor of severing their political
connection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4,
 Jefferson's draft
of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,
was adopted. The old bell 
in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang
out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermo
st
hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among
the powers of the world.

To some documents
 is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence
is one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with
 it; but
patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of
its language or the severity of its in
dictment give it a secure place in
the records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
that it i
s one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
ideal which for three centuries has been taking form a
nd spreading
throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down
thrones and aristocracies, breaking
 the armies of irresponsible power on
battle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That
ideal, now
 so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple
sentence: "Governments derive their just powers from the cons
ent of the
governed."

Written in a "decent respect for the opinions of mankind," to set forth
the causes which impel
led the American colonists to separate from
Britain, the Declaration contained a long list of "abuses and
usurpations
" which had induced them to throw off the government of King
George. That section of the Declaration has passed into 
"ancient"
history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for
government and giving a new dignity 
to the common man that has become a
household phrase in the Old World as in the New.

In the more enduring passages t
here are four fundamental ideas which,
from the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of
revol
ution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable rights including life,
 liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these
rights; (3) governments deri
ve their just powers from the consent of the
governed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
the
se ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
institute new government, laying its foundations on 
such principles and
organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
effect their safety and h
appiness. Here was the prelude to the historic
drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every

privilege not founded on popular assent.


THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE

=The Committees of
 Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into
armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate
 their
forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for
the means were at hand in town meetings,
 provincial legislatures, and
committees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were
in fact the comm
ittees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial
groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sent
iment.
As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston
under the leadership of Samuel Adams. 
It held regular meetings, sent
emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education
in the doctrin
es of liberty.

[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]

Upon lo
cal organizations similar in character to the Boston committee
were built county committees and then the larger colon
ial committees,
congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the
revolutionary elements. Ordinarily t
he provincial convention was merely
the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
controlled 
by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was
built the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under
 the
Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the
United States. This was the revolutionary
 government set up within the
British empire in America.

=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new a
ssemblies of
the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal
provinces the governor, the judges, 
and the high officers fled in haste,
and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to
the col
onies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
themselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickl
y acted upon.
Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and N
ew York had drafted new constitutions
as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and
Rhode 
Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king 
and went on as
before so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,
which had drafted a temporary p
lan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
complete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much
deli
beration put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its
essential features remains unchanged to-day.

The n
ew state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
models. For the royal governor was substituted a gov
ernor or president
chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and
Massachusetts, by popular vo
te. For the provincial council there was
substituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or
assembly
, was continued virtually without change. The old property
restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in so
me states, was
continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
deprived of the ballot. The spec
ial qualifications, laid down in several
constitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated
that 
the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
experiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, li
ke Mrs. John
Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a
government which excluded them from 
political rights were treated as
mild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were
allowed to vo
te for many years on the same terms as men.

By the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of

authority derived from any source save "the people," were swept aside
and republican governments on an imposing scale
 presented for the first
time to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared
by plain citizens we
re translated into French and widely circulated in
Europe. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspirati
on to
a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the
democratic revolution in the Old World.


=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions
was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders
. They had only to build
on foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of
government was anothe
r matter. There had always been, it must be
remembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans

had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the
crown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, t
he patriot leaders,
accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for
action on a national stage
.

Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of
national destiny. There were differences in e
conomic interest--commerce
and industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There
were contests over t
he apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
for common defense. To these practical difficulties were added loc
al
pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men wit
h a large outlook upon
the common enterprise.

Nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
federa
tion. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work
before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the 
desirability of a
permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go
into a committee of the whole
 on the state of the union, and Franklin,
undaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again
pres
ented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed
and it was not until late in 1777 that Congress 
presented to the states
the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed
ratification, and it was the spr
ing of 1781, a few months before the
surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the
states, appr
oved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all
that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for 
neither a
chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a
Congress of delegates in which each sta
te had an equal voice and gave it
the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
government--money a
nd soldiers.

=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were
taken in the direction of indep
endent government, the patriots devised
and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
the 
new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental
Congress agreed not to allow the importation of Briti
sh goods, it
provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such
agencies were duly formed by th
e choice of men favoring the scheme, all
opponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those
who p
ersisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or
punished according to circumstances. As soon as the new 
state
constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the
same way to ferret out all who were not
 outspoken in their support of
the new order of things.

[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]

These patriot agencies, 
bearing different names in different sections,
were sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to

sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "association test."
Those who refused were promptly branded as outl
aws, while some of the
more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at
one time held the form
er governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New
York. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The
blac
k-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
persons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loy
alists or Tories who
were bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were
suppressed and their pamphlets b
urned. In many places, particularly in
the North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
proceeds appl
ied to the cause of the Revolution.

The work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was
sometimes su
pplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without
trial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was pla
ced upon a cake
of ice and held there "until his loyalty to King George might cool."
Whole families were driven out o
f their homes to find their way as best
they could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British
governm
ent gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,
but they were defended on the ground that in effect a
 civil war, as well
as a war for independence, was being waged.

=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or 
another, those who
were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
preferred to be subjects of 
King George. Just what proportion of the
Americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
British 
monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution
was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point o
f numbers we have
conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a
careful and informed observe
r, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds
of the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third
opp
osed the Revolution at all stages.

On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,
extravagant c
laims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of
the first Continental Congress and had fled to England whe
n he saw its
temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not
one-fifth of the American people sup
ported the insurrection and that
"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great
Britain upon con
stitutional principles to independence." At the same
time General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four yea
rs,
declared that "more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the
king's government to the Congress' tyranny." I
n an address to the king
in that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that "the number
of Americans in his
 Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
enlisted by Congress to oppose them."

=The Character of the Loyalists.
=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,
more than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according
to a 
careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the province by
virtue of their official rank; of their dignified calli
ngs and
professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture." The act
of banishment passed by Massachusetts 
in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,
"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of
New England,"
 more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard
College. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely
, that
the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,
clergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion
 the loyalists fought
against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
for a life of uncertainty
 in Canada or the mother country.

=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined
the Briti
sh army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
cause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the pa
triots in
editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared
that the members of Congress were "obs
cure, pettifogging attorneys,
bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc." The people and their
leaders they chara
cterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
dregs of mankind." The generals in the army they sneered at as "men
 of
rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress."

=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung
 by Tory taunts,
patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
opinion favorable to the Amer
ican cause. Moreover, they had to combat
the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
war
. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the
winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada i
nto the revolution--a
disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in
1776 as he was defeated
 on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and
beaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almo
st
too great for the stoutest patriots.

Pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs
of 
the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,
forsook the classroom for the field of political co
ntroversy. The poet,
Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated
the spirit of liberty in 
many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,
and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,
batt
le anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress
afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportun
ities for sermons.
"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?" anxiously inquired John
Adams in a letter to his wife
. The answer was decisive. "The clergy of
every denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten
eve
ry Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God
most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable s
uccesses. They pray
for the American army."

Thomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of
Wash
ington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New
Jersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of su
ch reverses on the
army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great
appeal to his countrymen 
in his pamphlet, "The Crisis," the first part
of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This

tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. "These are the
times that try men's souls," he opened. "The
 summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
country; but he that st
ands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
and women." Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding ever
y
one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, self-interested fear." He
deplored the inadequacy of the militia and
 called for a real army. He
refuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster
and he promised vic
tory soon. "By perseverance and fortitude," he
concluded, "we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and

submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a
depopulated city, habitations without safety a
nd slavery without
hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it." His ringing call to
arms was followed by another 
and another until the long contest was
over.


MILITARY AFFAIRS

=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened w
ith the battle of
Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of
Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19
, 1781, passed through two distinct
phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in
1778, and 
the second until the end of the struggle. During the first
phase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outst
anding
features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,
the expulsion of American forces from Ne
w York and their retreat through
New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the
British (Septe
mber, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his
capture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of
 American
forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.

The final phase of the war, opening with the tr
eaty of alliance with
France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,
the West, and the South. 
In the first sphere of action the chief events
were the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of
Mo
nmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying
American forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to 
West Point. In the
West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois
country, secured Kaskaskia and Vi
ncennes and laid a firm grip on the
country between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second
period ope
ned with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,
conquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 17
80 they seized
Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under
Gates at Camden, and overran S
outh Carolina, though meeting reverses at
Cowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis
began
 the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into
North Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court Ho
use, retired to the
coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and
fortified Yorktown, wher
e he was penned up by the French fleet from the
sea and the combined French and American forces on land.

=The Geogra
phical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of
the war offered many problems. From first to last it exte
nded from
Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was
nearly three thousand miles from th
e main base of supplies and, though
the British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly
falling prey t
o daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The
sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportati
on between
points along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of
wealth and population. Of this the
 British made good use. Though early
forced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end
of the 
war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
the approach of the French fleet; and they captured a
nd held both
Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest
of cities.

Particularly was this
 true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small
portion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from
 the
coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on
the produce of the soil, not upon the p
rofits of trade. This very fact
gave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far
from the port
s of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced
to surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut
 off from his
base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they
were harassed and worried by th
e guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,
and Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far
in th
e interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.
Sustained by their own labor, possessing the inte
rior to which their
armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the
Americans could not be h
emmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
blow.

=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in c
utting
off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
United States. As an agricultural coun
try, the ruin of its commerce was
not such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though
somewhat rude l
ife were right at hand. It made little difference to a
nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chin
aware were
cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.

Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul 
Jones and Captain John Barry
materially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American
seamen and thei
r courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of
British marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress 
of the
seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the
hundreds of privateers and minor captains 
who overhauled British supply
ships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the
French fleet was 
thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to
reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based 
upon the
possibilities of a maritime disaster.

=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is
dif
ficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.
There is no doubt that all the British commande
rs were men of experience
in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the
French War and was
 accounted an excellent officer, a strict
disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,
societ
y, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to
overwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortabl
e bases at New York
and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John
Burgoyne, to whom was gi
ven the task of penetrating New York from
Canada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and
Eur
ope. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
after the collapse of his plans and the surrender o
f his army in 1777,
he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who
directed the movement whic
h ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,
had "learned his trade on the continent," and was regarded as a man of

discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose
achievements at Camden and Guilford were blo
tted out by his surrender at
Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted
talents which he af
terward displayed with great credit to himself in
India. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability
,
they all had training and experience to guide them.

[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]

The Americans had a host in
 Washington himself. He had long been
interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
during t
he first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He
had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as
 plagued some of
the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He
was reserved and patient, lit
tle given to exaltation at success or
depression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, "what held
the patr
iot forces together?" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John
Marshall_. Then he answers: "George Washington and he alone
. Had he
died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....
Washington was the soul of the American
 cause. Washington was the
government. Washington was the Revolution." The weakness of Congress in
furnishing men and
 supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at
ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers again
st him
such as the "Conway cabal," the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the
treason of Benedict Arnold, while they 
stirred deep emotions in his
breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did
not shake his iro
n will or his firm determination to see the war through
to the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was

immeasurable.

Of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have
been experienced military men w
hen the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the
unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book
seller, a
nd ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called
him to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a "seaso
ned soldier"
because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at
Braddock's memorable defeat, and
 had served with credit during the Seven
Years' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.
The t
riumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing
defeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensi
ons. Nathanael
Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience
who, when convinced that war wa
s coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and
took up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South
Ca
rolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
with the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. 
Daniel Morgan, one of the
heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen
some fighting duri
ng the French and Indian War, but his military
knowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was
ne
gligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New
Hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty 
summoned him to
lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a
Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor 
who, on hearing the clash of arms,
read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for
service. Such 
is the story of the chief American military leaders, and
it is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the F
rench and
Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
troops commanded according to the 
strategy evolved in European
experience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of
the country the
y had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought
during the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in t
he
balance.

=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added
military talent from beyond the seas
. Baron Steuben, well schooled in
the iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined
Washington a
t Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen i
nto regular
soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from
Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;
--all acquainted with the arts of war
as waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.
Lafayette cam
e early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by
several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally thro
ughout the
war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the
siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camd
en. Kosciusko survived the American
war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these
distinguished
 foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American
revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and disc
ipline which
fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
power of the first rank.

=The 
Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their
annals are short and simple. The regulars from the st
anding army who
were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up
by special efforts at home, and
 the thousands of Hessians bought
outright by King George presented few problems of management to the
British officer
s. These common soldiers were far away from home and
enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined a
nd many
of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George
fought bravely, as the records of Bunker H
ill, Brandywine, and Monmouth
demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,
some of the high 
officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
their own kin; but they obeyed orders.

The Americans, on the oth
er hand, while they fought with grim
determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in
discipline and i
n the experience of regular troops. When the war broke
in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There 
was no
continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of
them experienced in fighting but few of t
hem "regulars" in the military
sense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,
unaccustomed to severe 
discipline, and impatient at the restraints
imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually
leav
ing the service just at the most critical moments. "The militia,"
lamented Washington, "come in, you cannot tell how;
 go, you cannot tell
where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at
last at a critical moment.
"

Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of
regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly tra
ined and paid according to
some definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,
the chronic fear of
 civilians in Congress and to wring from that
reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
bon
us to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this
scheme, which Washington regarded as far short of j
ustice to the
soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the
conflict before he had an army of
 well-disciplined veterans capable of
meeting British regulars on equal terms.

Though there were times when militiam
en and frontiersmen did valiant and
effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
time-honored traditi
on that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
forces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did

nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,
and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunk
er Hill, Long Island, White
Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen
overcome an equal numb
er of British regulars in an open trial by battle.
"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier,"
 wrote
Washington, "requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and
undisciplined recruits as from veteran 
soldiers is to expect what never
did and perhaps never will happen."

=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the Americ
an army win the war? For
one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British
generals who, in 1775 an
d 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with
large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
paralyzi
ng blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American
army. "Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy
 could have saved
us," solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that
this apparent supineness was
 not all due to the British generals. The
ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
loya
l and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
war vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly i
nactivity was obviously
better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
healing. Later in the confl
ict when the seasoned forces of France were
thrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things
a
bout the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were
embarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their tr
oops could not forage
with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The
long oversea voyages we
re uncertain at best and doubly so when the
warships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply
bo
ats.

The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
outdone on two important occasions by su
perior forces--at Saratoga and
Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which
could be rais
ed only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue
the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accompli
shed at all.
They learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the
scene of endless uprisings call
ing for an army of occupation. That was a
price which staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there
were 
forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.

=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of Ameri
ca indifferent
to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of
opinion they did their part in 
creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth
Timothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to
espou
se the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James
Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrym
en to rest their case
upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the
leaders to stand fast by th
eir principles. While John Adams was tossing
about with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing

letters to him declaring her faith in "independency."

When the war came down upon the country, women helped in ever
y field. In
sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a
tireless pen combatted loyalist propagan
da in many a drama and satire.
Almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
service in the "
second line of defense." Mrs. Washington managed the
plantation while the General was at the front and went north to 
face the
rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her
husband and his men. The daughter of Benja
min Franklin, Mrs. Sarah
Bache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set
the women of Pennsylv
ania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even
near the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, ha
uling
powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
lives.

In the economic sphere, the work of 
women was invaluable. They harvested
crops without enjoying the picturesque title of "farmerettes" and they
canned an
d preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their
labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: "Immedia
tely on being cut
off from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their
own families in manufactur
ing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
They thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
l
abors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
themselves. In this way the female part of families by t
heir industry
and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,
evincing the strength of their attac
hment and the value of their
service."

For their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more
than one
 occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even
as in our own day. Washington thanked them for their l
abors and paid
tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
given to the cause of independence
.


THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION

When the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in
America but 
no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was
in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Havi
ng no authority
to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
provincials for taxation, it resorted
 mainly to loans and paper money to
finance the war. "Do you think," boldly inquired one of the delegates,
"that I wi
ll consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quir
e of which will
pay for the whole?"

=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political
economy
, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of
credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of 
their respective
populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about
$241,000,000 of continental pap
er was printed, to which the several
states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came
interest-bearing 
bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions
were also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and 
Spain. In
desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The
property of Tories was confiscated a
nd sold, bringing in about
$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to
raise revenues for the
 continental treasury, but the states, burdened
with their own affairs, gave little heed.

=Inflation and Depreciatio
n.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it
rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
o
nly two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by
Congress and the states to compel people to accept th
e notes at face
value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.
Speculators collected at once to fatte
n on the calamities of the
republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public
securities while th
e patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley
Forge. "Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling," excl
aimed
Washington, "afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
virtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the 
depreciation of our currency
... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
the enemy."

=The 
Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the
war were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn
 Solomon, a merchant
of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,
Jefferson, and Monroe, and arm
y officers, like Lee and Steuben, with
money for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of
half 
a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,
if not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Anothe
r Philadelphia
merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the "patriot
financier" because he labored night 
and day to find the money to meet
the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own
funds were exh
austed, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the
handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important po
ints to
distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as
well as financial talents.

[Illustratio
n: ROBERT MORRIS]

Women organized "drives" for money, contributed their plate and their
jewels, and collected from d
oor to door. Farmers took worthless paper in
return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
y
ielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,
the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floa
ting of loans,
borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress
staggered through the Revolution l
ike a pauper who knows not how his
next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
kindly fa
te.


THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION

When the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
their 
commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and
supplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, 
and the women
who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
achievements of diplomacy. The i
mportance of this field of activity was
keenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were
fair
ly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of
power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices o
f nations and their
rulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening
relations with continental c
ountries and seeking money, supplies, and
even military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,
th
ey created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.

=Americ
an Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a
friendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, i
n March, 1776, sent a
commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the
"first American diplomat." 
Later in the year a form of treaty to be
presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and
Dean
e were selected as American representatives at the court of "His
Most Christian Majesty the King of France." John Jay
 of New York was
chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the
same year; and other agents wer
e dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and
Berlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two
fruitless year
s there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity and
experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure." Frederick 
the Great,
king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for
Silesian linens and woolens, but, fear
ing England's command of the sea,
he refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.

=Early French Interest.=
--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution
was won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion
,
although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis
XVI's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, bef
ore the arrival of any
American representative, had brought to the attention of the king the
opportunity offered by t
he outbreak of the war between England and her
colonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and
"r
educe the power and greatness of England"--the empire that in 1763 had
forced upon her a humiliating peace "at the pr
ice of our possessions,
of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,
Louisiana, Isle Royale
, Acadia, and Senegal." Equally successful in
gaining the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,
Beaumarcha
is, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two
popular plays, "Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." The
se two men had
already urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared
on the scene. Shortly after h
is arrival they made confidential
arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to
the struggli
ng colonies, although official requests for them were
officially refused by the French government.

=Franklin at Pari
s.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only
in private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French peopl
e,
however, made manifest their affection for the "plain republican" in
"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester ve
lvet." He was known among
men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of
extraordinary ability. His "
Poor Richard" had thrice been translated
into French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
kingdom. P
eople of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,
peasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished 
him success in
his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a
revolution soon to follow, playe
d with fire by encouraging "our dear
republican."

For the king of France, however, this was more serious business. E
ngland
resented the presence of this "traitor" in Paris, and Louis had to be
cautious about plunging into another war
 that might also end
disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris
was a dark hour for the 
American Revolution. Washington's brilliant
exploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with
Cornwall
is at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,
the loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, 
and the retirement
to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and
Philadelphia--two strategic ports--we
re in British hands; the Hudson
and Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British
troops was on
 his way down through the heart of northern New York,
cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonde
r the
king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in
from all sides by the American forces, his
 flanks harried, his foraging
parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,
1777, to General 
Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to
receive the honor.

=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=
--News of this victory,
placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,
reached Franklin one ni
ght early in December while he and some friends
sat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at on
ce
the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with
such haste that he upset his coach and di
slocated his arm. The king and
his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
Revolution. Tre
aties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
in February, 1778. The independence of the United States was 
recognized
by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.
Combined military action was agreed u
pon and Louis then formally
declared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought
one another in the
 wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of
Abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pit
t
had erected and that George III was pulling down.

=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remem
bering
the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and
hoping to drive the British out of Gibral
tar, once more joined the
concert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of
armed neutrals formed 
in protest against British searches on the high
seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and
A
merica to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England
was added the danger of a possible revolt in Ir
eland, where the spirit
of independence was flaming up.

=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists 
about to be
joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North
proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal
 of negotiations. By solemn
enactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right
of imposing taxes 
within the colonies; at the same time it authorized
the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to A
merica.
A truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws
suspended, and the old imperial constituti
on, as it stood before the
opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events
had taken the affa
irs of America out of the hands of British
commissioners and diplomats.

=Effects of French Aid.=--The French allianc
e brought ships of war,
large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable
body of trained soldiers
 to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this
help, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British

evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and
Washington's troops were encouraged to come out of V
alley Forge. They
inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable
conduct of General Charles L
ee prevented a triumph. The recovery of
Philadelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of
Savann
ah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.

The full effect of the French alliance was not felt unt
il 1781, when
Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by
French troops Washington swept ra
pidly southward and penned the British
to the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.
It wa
s this movement, which certainly could not have been executed
without French aid, that put an end to all chance of re
storing British
dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that
caused Lord North to pace th
e floor and cry out: "It is all over! It is
all over!" What might have been done without the French alliance lies
hid
den from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French
soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is 
known to all the
earth. "All the world agree," exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to
General Washington, "that no e
xpedition was ever better planned or
better executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
the lat
est posterity." Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
reward.


PEACE AT LAST

=British Opposition to the War.=-
-In measuring the forces that led to
the final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to
remembe
r that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home
faced a powerful, informed, and relentless oppositi
on. There were
vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
the unhappy quarrel, then again
st the way in which the war was waged,
and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
American dom
inions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered
against the government were the first statesmen and orators of 
the land.
William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American
independence, denounced the governme
nt as the aggressor and rejoiced in
American resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against
every measu
re of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while
giving independence to America, would work for reconciliat
ion rather
than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous
sympathy and warmly championed their r
ights. Outside of the circle of
statesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David
Hume, the philoso
pher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author
of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washingt
on in
seeing it through.

Against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army
of scribes and journ
alists to pour out criticism on the Americans and
their friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this busines
s,
was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
before printing them. Far more weighty was Ed
ward Gibbon, who was in
time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire_. He had at fi
rst opposed the government; but, on being given a
lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his
f
riends to ridicule him in these lines:

    "King George, in a fright
     Lest Gibbon should write
       The story 
of England's disgrace,
     Thought no way so sure
     His pen to secure
       As to give the historian a place."


=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side
of the opponents of the government's measures.
 They had predicted that
conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace
which would in some me
asure restore the affections of the Americans.
Every day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their

arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve
English burdens, made those burdens heavier t
han ever. Military expenses
were daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single
outlet for British go
ods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due
British merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed i
nto an
indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French
had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. 
In vain did the king assert in
December, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
peace that meant
 American independence. Parliament knew better, and on
February 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an addr
ess to the
throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,
and other friends of the colonies 
voted in the affirmative. Lord North
gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:
"Necessity ma
de me yield."

In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that
it was prepared to enter into 
negotiations leading to a settlement. This
was embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United
States
 had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
both nations in open conference. Finding France, howev
er, opposed to
some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American
commissioners conferred with th
e British agents at Paris without
consulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace
draft befo
re they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes
reproached him, Franklin replied that they "had been guilty 
of
neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work
would not be ruined by a single indiscretion.
"

=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783
was a triumph for America. England recognize
d the independence of the
United States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries
extending from the 
Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes
to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West
 Indies
intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.
Spain won Florida and Minorca but not 
the coveted Gibraltar. France
gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled
and the coloni
es independent.

The generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called
forth surprise and gratitude i
n the United States and smoothed the way
for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the
same t
ime they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. "This federal
republic is born a pigmy," wrote the Spanish ambas
sador to his royal
master. "A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus
formidable to these countries. L
iberty of conscience and the facility
for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the
advantages o
f the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans
from all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with
 grief the
tyrannical existence of the same colossus."

[Illustration: NORTH AMERICA ACCORDING TO THE TREATY OF 1783]



SUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD

The independence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European
state
smen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and
power; but no one could fix the hour of the great ev
ent. Until 1763 the
American colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There
were collisions from time t
o time, of course. Royal governors clashed
with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the
e
xercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on
the whole, the relations between America and the
 mother country were
more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which
closed in 1688.

The cras
h, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was
the product of a number of forces that happened to co
nverge about 1763.
Three years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,
proud, inexperienced, and st
ubborn king. For nearly fifty years his
predecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed
thin
gs to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would
be king in fact as well as in name. About the sa
me time England brought
to a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering
under a heavy burden 
of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly
in defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasona
ble
to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
the cost of their own defense. At this j
uncture there came into
prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and
controlling her trade, Gren
ville and Townshend. The king was willing,
the English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and
statesm
en were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set
out upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the co
lonists, regulated
their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This
action evoked protests from 
the colonists. They held a Stamp Act
Congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of
grievances. Some 
of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,
sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped
 paper.

Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed
the Stamp Act. Then it veered again an
d renewed its policy of
interference. Interference again called forth American protests.
Protests aroused sharper ret
aliation. More British regulars were sent
over to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.
Rioting
 again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and
seized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer wa
s more force.
The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An
unexpected and unintended clas
h of arms at Lexington and Concord in the
spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:
"The 
Americans are rebels!"

The die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was made
commander-in-chief. 
Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
volume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.
Fra
nklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced
France to throw her sword into the balance. Three y
ears later,
Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of
peace, George III acknowledged the i
ndependence of the United States.
The new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
Atlantic Ocean 
to the Mississippi River, began its career among the
sovereign powers of the earth.

In the sphere of civil governmen
t, the results of the Revolution were
equally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven
from the f
ormer dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.
All the colonies became states, each with its own consti
tution or plan
of government. The thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
Articles of Confederation. A 
republic on a large scale was instituted.
Thus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
world h
ad never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down
and be supplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole c
ontinents hung upon
the answer.

HE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS




CHAPTER VII

THE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION


THE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES 
OF AMERICA

The rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed
by officials popularly elected un
der constitutions drafted by "the plain
people," was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. The
majo
rity of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounc
ed it good. Those
Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that
the Declaration of Independe
nce, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm "uninstructed by experience,"
co
uld not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All
around them they saw chaos in finance and in i
ndustry and perils for the
immediate future.

=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under

the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
necessary to cope with the problems of recon
struction left by the war.
The sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to
seven members from eac
h state chosen as the legislature might direct and
paid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had on
e
vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no
president to enforce the laws. Congress was 
given power to select a
committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body
when it was not in se
ssion; but this device, on being tried out, proved
a failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizen
s and
states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
they could compel obedience to law. The
 two great powers of government,
military and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could
authorize expendi
tures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
of contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the
est
ablishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply
their respective quotas of soldiers. It could n
ot lay taxes nor bring
any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It
could act only through the
 medium of the state governments.

=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,
the disorde
rs were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was
still outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either th
e interest or the
principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of
their bonds sank to twenty-five
 or even ten cents on the dollar. The
current bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was
not en
ough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
the transactions of the shadow legislature. The cu
rrency was in utter
chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere
trash worth a cent or two 
on the dollar. There was no other expression
of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: "not worth a
Continental.
" To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring
new streams of paper money from the press. Almost the onl
y good money in
circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the
public was even defrauded by the
m because money changers were busy
clipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The
entire Bri
tish system of trade discrimination was turned against the
Americans, and Congress, having no power to regulate forei
gn commerce,
was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.
Domestic commerce was impeded b
y the jealousies of the states, which
erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the
currency 
made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,
as if to increase the confusion, backward states enact
ed laws hindering
the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which
nothing but a national system of
 courts could cure.

=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the
laws unenforced, the tr
easury empty, and the public credit gone, the
Congress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon

the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be
treated with contempt. Even its own members lo
oked upon it as a solemn
futility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and
many who did take the
 doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
Again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transacti
on
of business.

=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to
pursue their own course with no
 interference from without, had almost as
many difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with
revolutionary 
debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
population. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discourage
d by the
fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of
several states joined in a concerted effor
t and compelled their
legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in
value, but nevertheless i
t was forced on unwilling creditors to square
old accounts.

In every part of the country legislative action fluctuat
ed violently.
Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
third year. Lands were sold by o
ne legislature and the sales were
canceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural
consequences. 
Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal t
ender in
payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily
in debt, on the other hand, urged ev
en more drastic action against
creditors.

So great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in
1786
 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the
taxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with 
difficulty that an
armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the
leadership of Daniel Shay
s, a captain in the Revolutionary army,
organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.
Shay
s and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmer
s, against the
lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the
senate of the state the members of 
which were apportioned among the
towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and
against the
 refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized
the towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the
 courts of
justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,
sending a shock of alarm to every ce
nter and section of the young
republic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to
quell the upris
ing; and when that task was accomplished, the state
government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because t
hey had
so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the
legislature who had been most zealous in t
heir attacks on the insurgents
were defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance
for state gover
nments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.

=Alarm
 over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,
watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the 
conclusion that
the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
careening into anarchy. "The facts o
f our peace and independence," wrote
a friend of Washington, "do not at present wear so promising an
appearance as I 
had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,
jealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
co
nfidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to
think that they will show themselves unworthy of 
the noble prize for
which we have contended."

Washington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's
r
ebellion, he exclaimed: "What, gracious God, is man that there should
be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his
 conduct! It is but the
other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
under which we now live
--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them." The same year h
e
burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. "I am
told that even respectable characters speak 
of a monarchical government
without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is
often but a single st
ep. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a
triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph f
or
the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
ourselves!"
